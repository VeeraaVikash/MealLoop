```

`Features/Staff/` is an addition to the planned layout: the Home, Alerts and Me shell is shared by four roles, so it does not belong to any one role's folder.

## Who owns what

| Folder | Owns | Changes need |
|---|---|---|
| `Domain/` | Every model and enum used by more than one screen | Review by one other person; update the OpenAPI file if the model crosses the network |
| `Data/Repositories/` | Repository protocols | The same, plus the demo and remote implementations in the same pull request |
| `Data/Demo/` | Seeded sample data and simulated behaviour | Each value cites its source document |
| `DesignSystem/` | Tokens and shared components | Values must exist in the design (Figma variables or the documented rules) |
| `Features/<Role>/` | That role's screens, view models and copy | The person assigned in `docs/SCREEN_INVENTORY.md` |

## Rules

1. **Features import Domain and never redefine models.** If a screen needs a new field, add it to `Domain/` once. No feature-local copy of `Meal`, `Shortage` and so on.
2. **Views never hold demo data.** A view gets every value from its view model, and the view model gets it from a repository. Interface wording lives in a `<Feature>Copy` enum; sample values live only in `Data/Demo/DemoSeed.swift`.
3. **Demo data never reaches a non-Debug build.** Everything in `Data/Demo/` is wrapped in `#if DEMO_DATA`. Only the Debug configuration sets that flag, and `AppEnvironment.swift` stops the build with `#error` if it is set without `DEBUG`. Never mix demo and real data in one environment.
4. **Missing is not zero.** Use `CountReading`, `Forecast`, `LeftoverMeasurement` and `PlateWasteMeasurement`. Never use a bare `Int` or `Double` for something that can be missing, and never default it to 0.
5. **Nothing fakes success.** Unbuilt actions open a "Not implemented" page; unimplemented repositories throw `RepositoryError.notImplemented`; an offline write is an error, never a result.
6. **Every screen loads through `LoadState` and renders through `AsyncContentView`**, so loading, empty, error, stale and offline look the same everywhere.
7. **View models are `@MainActor @Observable`** and take repositories and an `AppClock` in their initialiser. Use the clock for "now", never `Date()` in a view model, so tests and the demo can fix the time.
8. **Tokens only.** No hex values, font sizes or spacing literals in feature code. If a value is missing, add a token after checking the design, and record anything measured rather than documented.
9. **Staff navigation is Home, Alerts and Me.** Push screens with `StaffRoute`; do not add a fourth tab.
10. **AI stays optional.** Nothing in a dining flow may depend on `IntelligenceService`.
11. **New files need no project edit.** Folders are synchronised with the targets. A new `.md` file inside `ios/MealLoop/` must be added to the target's exceptions so it is not copied into the app bundle.
