# Backend proposal

**Status: proposal only.** No backend code exists. The first-slice contract is in [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml) (12 operations, validated with `openapi-spec-validator`). The decision record is [ADR-002](../adr/ADR-002-backend-shape.md).

## Shape: a modular monolith

One Spring Boot application (Java) with one PostgreSQL database. It is split into modules with hard boundaries, so a module can become a separate service later if there is a clear need.

| Module | Owns (tables only this module writes) | Talks to others by |
|---|---|---|
| `dining-core` | messes, meals, menus and dishes, intentions, headcounts (forecast, sent, adjustments with reason and history), vendor replies, entries, entered-without-voting, special passes | Publishes events: `MealStarted`, `MealClosed`, `EntryRecorded`, `HeadcountSent` |
| `mess-ops` | meal state transitions (start, close), shortages, waste reports (per-dish leftovers, plate waste), SOS cases (claims, checks, closing), staff role passwords and device lockouts | Reads dining-core through its Java interface, never its tables. Publishes `ShortageReported`, `WasteRecorded`, `SOSRaised` |
| `outings` | outing requests and their state machine, guardian evidence references, warden decisions, gate exit and return events | Publishes `GateExit`, `GateReturn`. Dining reads confirmed exits only |
| `notifications` | the transactional outbox, delivery attempts, push tokens | Consumes events from the outbox; retries until delivered or marked failed |
| `intelligence` *(later, optional)* | nothing in the core database | A separate Python service that reads exported, verified data and returns advisory suggestions. Core endpoints never call it synchronously |

Rules:

- A module reads another module's data only through that module's public interface (or its events), never by joining its tables. This is what makes a later split possible.
- Each module has its own package, its own Flyway migrations folder and its own tests. An ArchUnit (or Spring Modulith) test fails the build if one module imports another's internals.
- Events are written to an **outbox table in the same transaction** as the change, then delivered by the notifications module. Nothing is lost when push delivery fails.

## Why not microservices, Kafka or Kubernetes now

- **The team is four people, mostly learning.** One deployable, one database and one set of logs are far easier to build, debug and demo for External Review 4 (27 to 29 January 2027).
- **The load is small.** The pilot is one mess. Thousands of entries per meal do not need a message broker.
- **Correctness matters more than scale.** Idempotent entries, "missing is not zero" and the meal state machine are easier to guarantee inside one transaction than across services.
- **Docker alone does not give resilience.** Isolation comes from data ownership, timeouts, durable events (the outbox) and failure testing. The modular monolith keeps those properties without network hops.
- **Revisit when** a module needs independent scaling or release cadence, or a team owns it separately. The intelligence service is the expected first split, because it uses Python and is optional by design.

## Reliability principles

1. **Core dining works with AI down.** No dining endpoint calls the intelligence service. Forecasts start as a statistical baseline computed inside `dining-core`; any ML model is optional and compared against that baseline.
2. **Scans are idempotent.** `POST /meals/{mealId}/entries` requires an `Idempotency-Key`. A repeated key returns the original response. A second entry for the same student and meal returns `409 already_recorded`, and the count does not change. A unique constraint on (meal, student) backs this in the database.
3. **Offline scans are never shown as recorded.** If the server cannot verify and save an entry, the request fails and the app shows "This entry is NOT recorded". Queueing scans offline is an open decision; the draft is "never record".
4. **Notifications retry from durable records.** Every notification starts as an outbox row in the same transaction as the change, with retries and a visible failed state. "Seen" is stored only when the receiver confirmed it.
5. **Missing data stays missing.** Counts are `available` or `unavailable`; leftovers are `entered`, `noneLeft`, `notMade` or `notEntered`. No column defaults a measurement to 0.
6. **Audit trails.** Headcount adjustments, meal start and close, shortage resolution and SOS closing store who, when and why.
7. **Role and mess checks on every request.** The bearer token carries the role and the mess; the server checks both on every endpoint.

## First slice (what the OpenAPI covers)

Student answers a meal → headcount → staff session → meal start → door entry → live and final counts → shortage → meal close → waste report. Feedback, Community, special passes, outings and admin results are not in this slice.

## Data notes

- Times are stored in UTC and shown in the mess's time zone (Asia/Kolkata for the pilot).
- The demo data in the iOS app is never loaded into the backend database. Seeded backend data, if any, lives in a separate schema or database, is labelled as seeded, and is excluded from analytics.
