# MealLoop screen inventory

Generated on 2026-10-23 from the repository only (no Figma access in this session). Source of each row: the file → frame tables in `design/audit/export*/README.md` (every listed PNG exists), cross-checked against every `archive_index.md`, the run reports and `STATE.md`. Screen names reuse the export / reference-pack image names. Figma node IDs are copied only where an export README records them; nothing is guessed.

**How to read it**

- One row per exported frame (a screen or a distinct state). Frames that exist in Figma but were never exported are not listed one by one; see *Needs review*.
- *Status*: **Active** = current requirement from the latest pack or run. **Needs review** = conflicting or superseded-but-not-archived, owner to decide. **Archived** = on page 99 or replaced by a newer decision; *not a requirement*.
- *Shared component dependencies* are proposed from the Figma component names recorded in `STATE.md` and the run reports, matched by screen type. Confirm when building.
- *Proposed priority*: P0 = first vertical slice (student answers a meal, headcount, door scan, kitchen waste record, admin result, plus the staff entry and meal state they need); P1 = the rest of the active core roles; P2 = outings (Guardian, Warden, Gate, student outings); P3 = polish. **The owner decides.**
- *SwiftUI implementation status* starts at “Not started” and *Assigned owner* at “Unassigned”. “Code written, build and launch owner-reported” means Swift source exists on `feature/swiftui-foundation` and the owner reports it built and launched on their Mac; the screen's behaviour is not verified and the unit-test result is not yet recorded (see `docs/FOUNDATION_REPORT.md`).

- Archived rows: **89**.
- Needs-review rows: **20** (three of them stand for whole Figma pages: 294 student frames on page 04, 187 old admin frames on page 10, 333 stale Dark frames on page 05).

## Effort note against 10 November 2026

- **420 active exported screens and states**, plus the un-exported student frames on page 04 (up to 294 frames there in total). From 23 October to 10 November is 18 calendar days, 12 weekdays.
- With four people working weekdays only, that is **8.8 exported screens or states per person per working day**, before the student page 04 remainder, before review and fixes, and while most of the team is still learning SwiftUI.
- Many rows are state variants of one screen (loading, offline, stale, sheet open). Grouping rows by their reference-image number (for example `K02`, `K02b`, `K02c` count once) gives **149 distinct base screens**, which is still **3.1 base screens per person per working day**. Shared components and `AsyncContentView` make the state variants cheaper, but each still needs data wiring, wording and a check against the export.
- Implementing every active frame by 10 November is **not realistic at a normal quality bar** unless the owner narrows the scope. Suggested reading: treat P0 as the 10 November commitment, P1 as stretch, and P2 and P3 as later. The owner decides.
