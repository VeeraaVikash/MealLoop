### Change log

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 0.2 | 2026-10-23 | Corrections on pull request 1 for the owner's decisions: Community publication is automatic after configured checks (FR-FB-005, FR-AI-002, FR-AI-008, FR-FB-007); participation credits with a conditional accuracy bonus (FR-RWD-003, FR-RWD-002); outing eligibility split into pilot mode and post-pilot mode (FR-OUT-024, new FR-OUT-028 to FR-OUT-030); the warden phone fallback needs institutional approval (FR-OUT-010); the prototype's shared staff password is demo behaviour only, with proposed production authentication (FR-ATT-013, new FR-ATT-015); the archived calorie tracker is no longer named as active (FR-ADM-017). Foundation status now reads built and launched on the owner's Mac (owner-reported). Every open decision is classified. New risks R10 to R12. The PRD is still a draft for review and is not owner-approved. |
| 0.1 | 2026-10-23 | First consolidated draft. Brings the latest owner decisions and the active design packs into one requirements document, records contradictions with older documents, and adds the requirements traceability matrix ([`REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md`](REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md)). |

## 2. Purpose and scope

**Purpose.** This document states what MealLoop must do, in testable requirements, so the team can move through the sequence PRD → non-functional requirements → C4 architecture → ADRs → data model → API contracts → technical review → implementation.

**In scope.** Product behaviour for the Phase 1 pilot at Meenakshi Girls' Mess and the roles around it: Student, Door Scanner, Pass Desk, Kitchen Staff, Supervisor, Admin (Food head), and the outing roles Guardian, Warden and Gate.

**Out of scope for this document.** Numbers for availability, performance and retention (the non-functional requirements task), architecture and technology choices (the C4 and ADR tasks), the data model and API detail, and any policy that SRM or the owner has not decided. Where a policy is undecided this document says so and does not choose.

**How to read it.**

- Every requirement has a stable ID (`FR-<AREA>-NNN`), a statement, testable acceptance criteria, dependencies, sources and **exactly one status label** ([section 16](#16-requirement-status-legend)).
- **Source order.** When documents disagree, the newest owner decision wins. Archived or superseded designs (Figma page 99, the archive indexes, the "(v1, superseded)" components) are never active requirements. The latest packs for the Door Scanner, Pass Desk, Kitchen, Supervisor and Guardian video override older text.
- **Contradictions are recorded, not hidden.** The Conflicts table in [`OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](OPEN_DECISIONS.md#conflicts) lists every place where an existing document disagrees with this one.
- **Implementation state.** No requirement is marked implemented for production. The iOS foundation in `ios/` was built and launched on the owner's Mac (owner-reported); the unit-test result is not yet recorded and no build output is in the repository ([`FOUNDATION_REPORT.md`](FOUNDATION_REPORT.md)). [`REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md`](REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md) keeps three states apart: foundation code exists; behaviour verified on a simulator or device (only what is evidenced); production functionality (unimplemented).
- **Sample data.** The design screens use placeholder names and sample numbers (for example "Main Mess", 860, 714, 774). They illustrate behaviour and are not measured results. The pilot is planned at Meenakshi Girls' Mess; whether the screens should be renamed is an owner decision.

## 3. Background and problem

SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, runs hostel messes that cook for large numbers of students without knowing in advance who will eat. The expected consequences are food left over on some days and shortages on others, queues at peak times, and feedback that gets no visible response. This section records the situation as the owner described it; none of it is measured by this project yet.

- **Pilot location.** Meenakshi Girls' Mess, which has a common entrance and exit doorway.
- **Today at the pilot mess.** There is no collection of meal intentions and no student entry scanning. MealLoop proposes per-meal intentions and QR-based entry verification.
- **Out of the initial pilot.** The boys' hostel has an existing Face ID attendance system; integrating it is outside the initial pilot scope.
- **Institution.** The institution has indicated cooperation. This is an indication, not a signed agreement.
- **What exists.** A detailed Figma design and its audit documents, an iOS SwiftUI foundation that runs on demo data and was built and launched on the owner's Mac (owner-reported; the unit-test result is not yet recorded), and a backend proposal. No production backend, no deployment and no measured result exist.

MealLoop is one operational system connecting students, door and desk staff, kitchen workers, supervisors and administrators. It is not an attendance app, a form replacement, a waste dashboard, a QR scanner or a chatbot.

**The loop.** Better student participation → more useful demand signals → better meal planning → verified operational outcomes → corrective action → continuous improvement.

## 4. Goals, non-goals and rollout phases

### Goals

1. **Reduce institutional mess food waste.** Phase 1 concentrates on **unserved food waste** (food left over after the meal, measured per dish) through student intentions, better headcount forecasting, verified entry and dish-wise waste measurement.
2. **Verified entry.** Know how many students actually entered, without denying anyone food.
3. **Honest measurement.** Keep intention, forecast, headcount, entries, leftovers and plate waste distinct, and never turn a missing measurement into a zero.
4. **Accountable feedback.** Turn student reports into owned corrective actions, and check whether things really improved.
5. **An earned, convenient digital outing option**, available first to an institutionally authorized pilot cohort and afterwards based on participation and reliability, with verified gate events as the only attendance-related evidence.

### Non-goals

- Dish-quantity planning, ingredient data, procurement or a vendor login. Management sends the vendor a headcount only; the vendor decides its own buffer, quantities and batches.
- Claiming real-time occupancy from entry scans, or exact waiting times.
- Automatic approval of a headcount or an outing.
- A supervisor approval loop for waste reports.
- Camera scanning at the Pass Desk (it would need a QR on the pass; this is an open decision, not part of the current design).
- Integrating the boys' hostel Face ID system in the initial pilot.
- Using NGO donation records as a measure of total unserved food.
- Native Android before iOS, and any claim that Android or any AI model is built.

### Rollout phases

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0: design and foundation | Figma design, audit documents, PRD, iOS foundation, backend proposal | In progress. The foundation was built and launched on the owner's Mac (owner-reported); the unit-test result is not yet recorded |
| Phase 1: pilot | Meenakshi Girls' Mess: intentions, forecasting, verified entry, dish-wise waste measurement, feedback and Community, and digital outings if SRM authorizes them | Not started. Depends on SRM authorization (see [section 14](#14-open-decisions)) |
| Phase 2: plate-waste reduction | Investigate an optional RFID and camera return station, only after Phase 1 shows value ([FR-KIT-018](#fr-kit-018--phase-2-optional-plate-waste-return-station)) | **PROPOSED**. Not part of the December 2026 delivery |

## 5. Stakeholders and roles

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|---|---|
| Students | Menus, meal plans, a fair way to answer, entry that never depends on answering, problem reports with visible follow-up, credits, outings |
| Door staff, pass-desk staff | Fast, honest entry recording with clear fallbacks |
| Kitchen staff | A forecast before the meal, a live count during it, a simple way to report shortages and record waste |
| Supervisors | Control of the meal state, shortage follow-up, SOS handling |
| Admin (Food head) | Headcount, vendor communication, results, corrective actions, menus, reports |
| Guardians, wardens, gate security | A trustworthy outing approval and gate record |
| Vendor | Receives a headcount; has no MealLoop login |
| SRM Institute of Science and Technology | Authorizes the pilot, privacy and consent, retention, rewards and outing policy |
| Development team | Four developers, mostly learning native iOS |

Notes:

- In the prototype, staff open a role with a shared role password (approved demo behaviour, [FR-ATT-013](#fr-att-013--prototype-staff-entry-uses-a-shared-role-password)); production authentication and authorization are proposed in [FR-ATT-015](#fr-att-015--production-staff-authentication-and-authorization).
- Staff, kitchen and door roles act within their own mess; wardens see their own hostel or block only; Admin can see all messes.
- The vendor has no login; the headcount is sent by message.

## 6. Guiding principles

These data-integrity rules apply to every requirement. A requirement that breaks one is a defect in the requirement.

| ID | Principle |
|---|---|
| DI-1 | **Intention is not attendance.** What a student said (I'm in, Skip, Not sure, No response) is never reported as who attended. |
| DI-2 | **Six headcount quantities stay separate:** Live forecast, Cutoff forecast, Approved headcount, Sent to vendor, Actual entries (live) and Final entries. They are never merged or substituted. |
| DI-3 | **Food produced, served, left over and plate waste are different things.** MealLoop does not know what was produced (the vendor cooked amount is Missing unless typed in) and never calls an entry "served". |
| DI-4 | **Missing is not zero.** A missing measurement is shown as missing; only a confirmed measurement of none (None left) is zero. |
| DI-5 | **Predicted crowd is not verified crowd.** Entry scans are never presented as current occupancy. |
| DI-6 | **An AI suggestion is not a decision.** An authorized person decides, and the actor is recorded. |
| DI-7 | **The entry QR confirms entry**, not that food was served or eaten. |
| DI-8 | **Incompatible units are never added.** Kilograms, litres and pieces stay separate. |
| DI-9 | **Live is not final.** Live entries are never labelled final; Final entries exist only after the Supervisor closes the meal. |
| DI-10 | **No success without a verified save.** An offline or unverifiable action is never shown as done and records nothing. |
| DI-11 | **Accountability.** Headcount changes, meal state changes, shortage resolution, waste edits, SOS closing and key decisions record who, when and why. |
| DI-12 | **Sample data is labelled and never mixed with real data.** |

## 7. Functional requirements by area

This section holds **161 requirements**. Each has an ID, a statement, acceptance criteria, dependencies, a source and exactly one status ([section 16](#16-requirement-status-legend)). The traceability matrix ([`REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md`](REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md)) adds the planned backend module, a test scenario and the implementation state for each.

**No requirement is currently marked `CHANGED, OWNER CONFIRMATION REQUIRED`.** The two items marked that way in version 0.1, FR-FB-005 (Community publication) and FR-RWD-003 (accuracy bonus), were resolved by the owner's decisions recorded in version 0.2.

### 7.1 Meal planning and student responses (`FR-MEAL`)

Students answer per meal, voluntarily, until two hours before it starts.

#### FR-MEAL-001 · Students can read the published menu

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** A student can read the published menu for each meal slot (Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner) of each day.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a mess has a published menu for a day, when the student opens Meals, then all four slots are available for that day with the dishes published for each.
2. Given a slot has no published menu, when the student opens it, then a No menu state is shown and no dish is invented.

#### FR-MEAL-002 · A meal response is I'm in, Skip, Not sure or No response

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** For each meal a student's state is exactly one of I'm in, Skip, Not sure or No response, and No response means no answer was given and is never treated as Skip.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student has not answered, when the meal is queried, then the state is No response and counts report No response separately from Skip.
2. Given the student taps Skip, when it is saved, then the state is Skip; given Not sure, then Not sure (never I'm in).
3. Given a count or report of responses, when it is shown, then I'm in, Skip, Not sure and No response are four separate groups.

**Dependencies:** none

**Source:** [`design/audit/design_intent.md`](../design/audit/design_intent.md) (Definitions: Intent; 'No response is its own group and is never a skip'); owner decision in task prompt

#### FR-MEAL-003 · Responses can be changed until two hours before the meal

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** A student can set or change the response until two hours before the meal starts, after which the answer controls are disabled and the server rejects changes.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a meal that starts at time T in the mess time zone, when the student answers one minute before T minus two hours, then the answer is saved.
2. Given the cutoff has passed, when the student opens the meal, then the answer buttons are disabled and a direct change request is rejected with cutoff_passed.
3. Given the cutoff has passed, when the student opens Home, then the entry QR is still available.

**Dependencies:** [FR-MEAL-004](#fr-meal-004--answering-is-voluntary-and-the-entry-qr-is-never-locked)

**Note.** Older Figma sample screens show lunch 9 AM and dinner 6 PM; those are sample times superseded by this rule (see the Conflicts table in docs/OPEN_DECISIONS.md, C-12).

#### FR-MEAL-004 · Answering is voluntary and the entry QR is never locked

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** No student loses access to food for skipping or not responding, and the entry QR is available in every response state.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student who chose Skip, Not sure, I'm in or did not respond, when they open Home or Entry QR, then Show entry QR is available.
2. Given the cutoff has passed, when the student opens Home, then answer buttons are disabled (dashed) while the QR still works.
3. Given a student with no response is scanned, when the door records the entry, then food access is unaffected (see FR-ATT-004).

**Dependencies:** [FR-ATT-004](#fr-att-004--no-decline-step-entries-without-a-response-are-listed-separately)

#### FR-MEAL-005 · Skipping reasons are optional

**Status:** `PROPOSED` · **Roles:** Student, Admin

**Statement.** A student who skips can optionally give a reason from a fixed list, and Skip saves without one; how reasons are used and how long they are kept is undecided.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the student chooses Skip, when the reason sheet is shown, then choosing a reason is optional and Skip saves without it.
2. Given reasons exist, when Admin views them, then they appear only in aggregate and never with a student name.
3. Given the retention and use of reasons are undecided, then no reason is used for credits or shown per student.

#### FR-MEAL-006 · One default reminder before the cutoff, plus optional reminders

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** A student gets one default reminder before the cutoff if they have not answered, and can add optional reminders under their own control.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student has not answered, when the default reminder time arrives, then one notification is sent before the cutoff and none after it.
2. Given Notification settings, when the student switches optional reminders on or off, then only the switched-on reminders are sent.
3. Given a student who has answered, when the default reminder time arrives, then no reminder is sent.

**Note.** Reminder timing is not documented (open decision).

### 7.2 Headcount and forecasting (`FR-HC`)

The headcount sent to the vendor, how it is produced, and the six quantities that are never merged (DI-2).

#### FR-HC-001 · The forecast accounts for every response category

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** The forecast uses I'm in, Skip, Not sure and No response, not only I'm in.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given responses in all four categories, when a forecast is produced, then all four are inputs and the Students view shows how many students are in each.
2. Given the forecast is shown, then it never presents I'm in as the headcount.

**Dependencies:** [FR-MEAL-002](#fr-meal-002--a-meal-response-is-im-in-skip-not-sure-or-no-response), [FR-AI-003](#fr-ai-003--forecasting-starts-from-a-statistical-baseline)

#### FR-HC-002 · Headcount quantities are separate and never merged

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin, Kitchen Staff, Supervisor

**Statement.** Live forecast, Cutoff forecast, Approved headcount, Sent to vendor, Actual entries and Final entries are separate, named quantities that are never merged or substituted for one another.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given any screen, API or report shows one of the six quantities, then it carries its own name and no field is filled from another.
2. Given the meal is in service, when entries are shown, then they are labelled live (Actual entries) and never final.
3. Given the meal has not closed, when Final entries are requested, then they are unavailable, not zero.

**Dependencies:** [FR-ATT-009](#fr-att-009--live-entry-count-is-shown-as-recorded-entries-only), [FR-SUP-002](#fr-sup-002--the-supervisor-closes-the-meal)

**Note.** Foundation gap: the Domain models have a forecast, a sent headcount and live and final counts, but no separate Live forecast, Cutoff forecast or Approved headcount.

**Note.** *Sent to vendor* means the approved headcount as published to the vendor account (FR-VEN-002); it is still a headcount only.

#### FR-HC-003 · The cutoff forecast is preserved

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** The forecast as it stood at the cutoff is preserved with its rule version and the cutoff time.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the cutoff has passed, when the live forecast later changes, then the cutoff forecast, its rule version and its time are unchanged and viewable.
2. Given a forecast is shown, then its rule version and the time it was set are visible.

**Dependencies:** [FR-HC-002](#fr-hc-002--headcount-quantities-are-separate-and-never-merged)

**Source:** [`design/audit/design_intent.md`](../design/audit/design_intent.md) (Definitions: Forecast (rule version and cutoff time); 'The forecast is preserved as it stood at the cutoff')

#### FR-HC-004 · Admin approves or adjusts the headcount with a reason

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** Admin reviews the forecast and approves it or adjusts it with a mandatory reason, and every approval and adjustment is kept in an audit history.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a forecast is ready, when Admin approves it, then the Approved headcount is set with who and when in the history.
2. Given Admin adjusts the headcount, when the reason is empty, then saving is refused.
3. Given an adjustment is saved, then the history shows the original value, new value, reason, actor and time, and cannot be edited.
4. Given a vendor account or any other role, then it cannot approve or alter the headcount (FR-VEN-005); only the Food Head / Admin role can.

#### FR-HC-005 · No automatic approval; reminders and escalation instead

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** If Admin does not respond, MealLoop sends reminders and escalates to authorized administrators, and it never approves or sends a headcount automatically.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a forecast awaits approval and no one responds by the reminder time, then Admin is reminded.
2. Given the reminder is unanswered, then the request is escalated to authorized administrators and the escalation is recorded.
3. Given no administrator responds at all, then the headcount stays not approved and nothing is made available to the vendor account.

**Dependencies:** [FR-HC-004](#fr-hc-004--admin-approves-or-adjusts-the-headcount-with-a-reason)

**Source:** owner decision in task prompt

**Note.** Who is an authorized administrator, the reminder times and the escalation order are open decisions (docs/OPEN_DECISIONS.md, P25).

#### FR-HC-006 · The vendor receives a headcount only

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin, Vendor

**Statement.** MealLoop makes the approved headcount available to the authorized vendor account for the assigned mess and nothing else: no dish quantities, no ingredient data, no procurement, no recipes and no automatic cooking recommendations. The vendor decides its own buffer, quantities and batches. The vendor is a MealLoop user, not an external API integration.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a headcount is published to the vendor account, then the vendor view shows the approved headcount for the meal and no dish quantity.
2. Given the data model and API, then no field holds a dish quantity to cook, and there is no direct vendor API.
3. Given the vendor's cooked amount is not recorded, then Vendor cooked shows Missing.

**Note.** Superseded in part: version 0.2 said the vendor has no login and receives the headcount by message. The vendor now has a restricted MealLoop account (confirmed product direction). The earlier message or call handoff (the Tell the vendor step) remains the designed interim handoff and is not removed. The vendor screens do not exist in Figma yet (docs/SCREEN_INVENTORY.md).

#### FR-HC-007 · Admin sees the vendor reply status

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** For each meal Admin sees whether the headcount is not sent, waiting for the vendor (pending acknowledgment), replied (acknowledged by the vendor account) or missing a reply.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a headcount was published and no acknowledgment exists, then the status is Waiting (pending acknowledgment) with the time since it was published.
2. Given the vendor account acknowledged, then the status shows Replied with the actor and the time of the acknowledgment.
3. Given a reply is expected and absent, then the status is Missing and is never shown as an agreement.
4. Given a headcount was published, then publishing is never shown as an acknowledgment (FR-VEN-003).

**Note.** In the current Figma design the reply is a status the admin records after a message or call (the designed interim handoff); with a vendor account the reply is the vendor's acknowledgment. Whether acknowledgment is mandatory before a deadline, the deadline, the escalation recipients, the fallback when the vendor cannot reach MealLoop and the authorized fallback process are OPEN (docs/OPEN_DECISIONS.md, P6, P64, P65).

#### FR-HC-008 · A change after sending is recorded and offered to the vendor

**Status:** `PROPOSED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** A change to the headcount after it was sent is recorded with a reason and time, and Admin is offered the Tell the vendor step.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a sent headcount, when Admin changes it, then a reason is required and the history shows before and after with the time.
2. Given a change after sending, then the vendor account shows it as an update (FR-VEN-004) and Admin can still tell the vendor through the designed interim message or call handoff.
3. Given the change happened late, then Results can later show it as We raised the headcount late.

**Note.** The Changed after sending frame and the headcount Tell the vendor sheet were archived by FIX-2 (design/audit/admin_redesign/archive_index.md) and are not requirements; this item rests on the admin sample data (We raised the headcount late) and needs product review.

### 7.3 Attendance verification and the Door Scanner (`FR-ATT`)

How entry is verified at the door. The entry QR confirms entry only (DI-7). The latest Door Scanner decisions override older documents.

#### FR-ATT-001 · The entry QR confirms entry only

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** Every student can show a live entry QR for the current meal, and the QR confirms entry, not that food was served or eaten.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student opens Entry QR during a meal, then a QR with a refresh countdown is shown.
2. Given a scan is recorded, then it is called an entry and no screen, API or report calls it served or eaten.

**Dependencies:** none

#### FR-ATT-002 · Scanning a valid QR records one entry

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner

**Statement.** When door staff scan a valid entry QR while the meal is in service, the entry is recorded once, the count goes up by one and the screen returns to the camera.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the meal is in service and a valid QR not yet recorded, when it is scanned, then Entry recorded shows the masked student ID and the count increases by one.
2. Given Entry recorded is shown, then the camera returns automatically and the entry holds time, student, meal and method.
3. Given the scan was recorded, then it is recorded with an idempotency key so a retry does not add a second entry.

#### FR-ATT-003 · Staff can type the last 4 digits when a QR cannot be scanned

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner

**Statement.** When a QR cannot be scanned, staff can type the last 4 digits of the student's SRM ID, choose from the matches and record the entry.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given four digits are typed and one student matches, when staff tap Record entry, then Entry recorded is shown.
2. Given more than one student matches, then a short list is shown to pick from.
3. Given no student matches, then a message names the digits and mess and offers Try again, and nothing is recorded.

#### FR-ATT-004 · No decline step; entries without a response are listed separately

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner

**Statement.** The Door Scanner has no decline step and no supervisor approval; a student with no meal response is recorded like any other entry and added automatically to a separate Entered without voting list, which is not a vote.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student with no response is scanned, then the same Entry recorded screen is shown and the count increases by one.
2. Given that entry, then the student appears in the Entered without voting list with masked ID and time, separate from all responses.
3. Given any Door Scanner screen, then none offers Decline or waits for a supervisor's approval.

#### FR-ATT-005 · A student is recorded at most once per meal

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner

**Statement.** A repeat scan of a student already recorded for the meal shows Already scanned with the first time and leaves the count unchanged.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student is already recorded, when scanned again, then Already scanned shows the first scan time and the count is unchanged.
2. Given the same idempotency key is sent again, then the original response is returned.
3. Given the server stores entries, then a second entry for the same student and meal is impossible.

#### FR-ATT-006 · Invalid and wrong-meal codes are rejected

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner

**Statement.** A code that is not a MealLoop entry code, or that is for another meal, is rejected with the reason and nothing is recorded.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a code that is not a MealLoop entry code, when scanned, then the screen says so and offers Scan again and Type the last 4 digits.
2. Given a code for another meal, when scanned, then the screen names that meal.
3. Given either case, then the count is unchanged.

#### FR-ATT-007 · An offline or unverifiable scan is never shown as success

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner

**Statement.** If an entry cannot be verified and saved, the app never shows success and records nothing, and staff can try again, type the digits or report a problem.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given no connection, when staff scan, then the screen says the entry is NOT recorded, shows the last update time and offers Try again, Type the last 4 digits and Report a problem.
2. Given that state, then the count and every list are unchanged and no entry is queued.
3. Given the connection returns, when staff try again, then the scan is verified and recorded normally.

**Note.** For the pilot, an offline scan is never recorded and never shown as success. A future offline queue is deferred and is not part of the pilot. *Superseded by NFR-REL-005 in [`NFR.md`](NFR.md) (the owner is asked to confirm); resolves the former open decision P5 (now R21).*

#### FR-ATT-008 · Scanning is open only while the meal is in service

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner, Supervisor

**Statement.** Door scanning is available only while the Supervisor has the meal in service: before the meal Home says when scanning opens, and after the meal is closed scanning is closed.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the meal has not started, then Home shows Scanning opens at the meal start and no scan is accepted.
2. Given the meal is in service, then the scanner is available.
3. Given the Supervisor closed the meal, then scanning is closed and the final recorded entries are shown.

#### FR-ATT-009 · Live entry count is shown as recorded entries only

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner, Kitchen Staff, Supervisor, Admin

**Statement.** During the meal the number of recorded entries is shown as live entries, labelled as students entered, never as meals served and never as the final count.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given entries are recorded, then the live count equals the number of recorded entries and excludes failed or offline scans.
2. Given the live count is shown, then it is labelled students entered (or recorded entries) and not served or final.
3. Given the count is unavailable, then it shows a dash or Unavailable and never 0.

#### FR-ATT-013 · Prototype staff entry uses a shared role password

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner, Pass Desk, Kitchen Staff, Supervisor

**Statement.** In the Figma prototype a staff member opens a role after entering a shared four-digit password for that role (three tries, then locked until the Supervisor resets it); this is approved demo behaviour for the prototype and is not an approved production security architecture.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the prototype, when the role is chosen and the correct password is entered, then the role Home opens with no separate Start Shift screen.
2. Given a wrong password, then the tries left are shown.
3. Given three wrong tries, then the prototype is locked with Ask your supervisor to reset it.
4. Given a production build, then a shared role password alone is not accepted as the authentication mechanism (FR-ATT-015).

**Note.** A prototype interaction only (a Debug or Figma behaviour), not an approved production method. Production staff use individual MealLoop-managed accounts (FR-ID-002); the mechanism details are proposed in FR-ATT-015.

#### FR-ATT-014 · Staff roles share Home, Alerts and Me

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner, Pass Desk, Kitchen Staff, Supervisor

**Statement.** Every staff role has the same three tabs (Home, Alerts, Me); Alerts puts an active SOS on top and Me shows the role, mess and shift.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given any staff role, then the bottom bar has Home, Alerts and Me and no fourth tab.
2. Given an SOS is active, then Alerts shows the SOS card first.
3. Given Me, then it shows initials, role, mess and an On shift state, and no invented name.

#### FR-ATT-015 · Production staff authentication and authorization

**Status:** `PROPOSED` · **Roles:** Door Scanner, Pass Desk, Kitchen Staff, Supervisor, Admin, Super Admin, Warden, Gate Security, Vendor

**Statement.** Production access must give every internal user an individually attributable identity: Students and Super Admins through SRM SSO (FR-ID-001) and all other internal users through individual MealLoop-managed accounts (FR-ID-002). Each user has an assigned role with mess or block scope, secure sessions with revocation, and auditable approvals, changes, scanning overrides and SOS actions. The exact mechanism is decided in the NFR, architecture and security reviews.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given any production action, then it carries the actor's individual identity, role and mess or block scope.
2. Given a session, then it is secure and can be revoked, and a deactivated account cannot perform protected operations.
3. Given an approval, a change, a scanning override, an SOS action, an account administration action or a vendor acknowledgment, then it is recorded in an audit trail with the actor.
4. Given the prototype's shared role password, then it is not accepted as the sole production credential.

### 7.4 Special meal pass and the Pass Desk (`FR-PASS`)

The special-meal pass is separate from hostel outing passes. The desk does not scan.

#### FR-PASS-001 · The special-meal pass shows a changing code and colour

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** An eligible student's special-meal pass shows a code and a colour that keep changing and says no scan is needed.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a valid pass for the meal, when the student opens it, then the code and colour change on a visible countdown.
2. Given the pass is not for today, expired, already used or for another mess, then the matching state is shown.
3. Given the pass is shown, then it states that no scan is needed and the desk checks the code and colour.

#### FR-PASS-005 · No pass, wrong meal and mismatch record nothing

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Pass Desk

**Statement.** No special pass, Wrong meal and Doesn't match each show the reason and record nothing; a student without a pass can still have the regular meal.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given no valid special pass, then the screen says so, records nothing and says the regular meal is still available.
2. Given a pass for another meal, then the screen names that meal and records nothing.
3. Given the code or colour does not match, then the expected values are shown with Nothing was recorded and Check again.

#### FR-PASS-007 · Pass reissue goes through the admin pass-exception flow

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Pass Desk, Admin

**Statement.** A request for a new pass goes to the existing admin pass-exception flow, and its status is Waiting, Approved, Done or Rejected, where Approved is never shown as Done.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given staff request a new pass, then the request is sent to the admin pass-exception flow with a reason.
2. Given Admin approves it, then the status is Approved and not Done.
3. Given the student actually has the new pass, then the status is Done.

#### FR-FB-003 · Urgent issues bypass Community and go to SOS

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** Urgent hygiene, contamination, illness or safety reports bypass Community and trigger direct escalation through the SOS workflow, and they never wait for votes.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given an urgent category, then the flow goes to Tell the counter staff now and the SOS steps, not to Community.
2. Given a food SOS, then a live photo with place and time and three checks are required before sending; I feel unwell may be sent without a photo.
3. Given the camera is denied, then Send without photo is offered and flagged on the admin Safety case.
4. Given an urgent report, then it is never published to Community, never held for Community support or an Admin publication decision, and it escalates through the SOS workflow.

#### FR-FB-004 · An SOS reaches staff and the admin Safety case

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student, Door Scanner, Pass Desk, Kitchen Staff, Supervisor, Admin

**Statement.** A student's SOS appears to staff on duty, who can claim and check it, the Supervisor can close it, and Admin sees it as a Safety case with the proof and who has acted.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student sends an SOS, then staff on duty see the SOS tab and card.
2. Given staff claim and check it, then the case records who and when, and stays open.
3. Given the Admin opens it, then the Safety case shows student, staff, vendor and admin steps with the proof.

#### FR-FB-005 · Community publication of non-urgent reports

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student, Admin

**Statement.** Eligible non-urgent student reports are published to Community automatically, without Admin action, after they pass the configured privacy, safety, abuse and spam checks; flagged or uncertain reports are held for Admin moderation.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given an eligible non-urgent report that passes the configured checks, when it is submitted, then it is published to Community without any Admin action, and the record shows the approved deterministic policy (and its version) that published it.
2. Given an urgent hygiene, contamination, illness or safety report, then it is never published to Community and it enters the urgent escalation workflow at once (FR-FB-003).
3. Given a report that is flagged or uncertain under the checks, then it is not published and is held in a queue for Admin moderation.
4. Given a published report, when Admin hides it, then it is no longer visible to students, the action is recorded with who, when and why, and Admin can intervene at any stage.
5. Given any Community view, API response or export, then no student identity (name, ID or any other identifier) is exposed publicly.
6. Given reports about the same problem, then duplicates are grouped into one issue so that supporters and Me too counts are not split.
7. Given an issue below any Me too threshold, then Admin can investigate it without waiting for votes (FR-FB-010).

#### FR-FB-007 · Rules and categories come first; AI is optional

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** Feedback handling is built in this order: (1) structured complaint categories; (2) deterministic routing and publication rules; (3) semantic duplicate detection; (4) an optional small or large language model, only after testing shows useful administrative value, and then only to advise or route to human moderation.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a report, then it is categorized with structured categories and routed and, if eligible, published by deterministic rules, without a language model.
2. Given reports describing the same problem, then semantic duplicate detection groups them.
3. Given a language model is proposed, then it is enabled only after testing shows useful administrative value, and it may only advise or route a report to human moderation.
4. Given the model is down or disabled, then submission, routing, publication and the Admin view still work.

#### FR-FB-009 · The Community support threshold is configurable

**Status:** `VALIDATION REQUIRED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** The support threshold is configurable and calibrated during the pilot, and there is no fixed number.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the threshold is a setting, then it can be changed without a release.
2. Given no threshold is set, then no automatic escalation is triggered by votes.
3. Given the pilot ends, then the chosen value is recorded with the evidence used.

#### FR-FB-011 · Corrective action completed is not improvement verified

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin, Student

**Statement.** An issue moves Sent, Seen, Working on it, Fixed (with Need more info and Reopened), records the owner, what was investigated, what was done and when, and Fixed means the corrective action was completed, not that improvement was verified.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given an issue, then its status uses these plain words only.
2. Given Admin marks it Fixed, then at least one recorded corrective action is required.
3. Given the action is complete, then the issue shows corrective action completed and improvement is a separate, later state set only from follow-up evidence.

#### FR-FB-012 · Student follow-up verifies real improvement

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student, Admin

**Statement.** After an issue is Fixed, students who reported or backed it can say whether it improved, and Admin evaluates real improvement from that follow-up.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given an issue is Fixed, then the relevant students are asked whether things improved.
2. Given answers arrive, then Admin sees the result as follow-up evidence and not as a percentage of waste.
3. Given insufficient answers, then the issue is not marked improvement verified.

#### FR-FB-013 · Feedback is aggregate and never shows names to staff

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin, Student

**Statement.** Feedback is shown to Admin in aggregate and never with student names; the private spending tracker never feeds admin data.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given Admin views feedback, then counts and problems are shown and no student name.
2. Given the spending tracker, then none of its data reaches any admin view.
3. Given a safety case, then the student appears only as a masked ID where documented.

**Note.** Whether staff see who sent a report is an open decision (design/README.md).

#### FR-FB-014 · Feedback and intent reasons need a retention rule

**Status:** `SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** How long feedback, skipping reasons and report photos are kept is decided before the pilot and then enforced.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a retention rule is approved, then data older than it is deleted or reduced as the rule says.
2. Given no rule is approved, then no personal feedback data is used beyond its original purpose.

**Dependencies:** none

#### FR-CRD-003 · Entry scans never become an occupancy claim

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student, Admin

**Statement.** MealLoop never claims current occupancy from entry scans: a crowd forecast is not verified current occupancy, cumulative entries are not occupancy, exit detection is not assumed, and predicted and verified crowd are labelled separately.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given entry scans, then no screen or API labels them as people currently inside.
2. Given an estimate of busy or quiet, then it is labelled predicted and kept apart from verified arrivals.
3. Given a wait time, then none is shown without validation.

### 7.10 Credits and rewards (`FR-RWD`)

Participation credits and a conditional accuracy bonus are confirmed; every amount, the verification method, the budget and the scheme need SRM approval or pilot validation.

#### FR-RWD-001 · Definite responses earn small participation credits

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** I'm in and Skip earn small participation credits when given before the cutoff, while Not sure and No response earn none.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a definite response before the cutoff, then a participation credit is granted once for that meal.
2. Given Not sure or No response, then no credit is granted.
3. Given a changed response, then at most one participation credit exists per student per meal.

#### FR-RWD-003 · Accuracy bonus requires reliably verified behaviour

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** In addition to participation credits, a student may earn an accuracy bonus when a definite answer matches reliably verified behaviour; a bonus is awarded only on trustworthy evidence, and credit corrections are auditable.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student answered I'm in or Skip before the cutoff and reliably verified behaviour matches the answer, then an accuracy bonus can be awarded in addition to the participation credit.
2. Given a Skip and no QR scan exists, then the Skip is not treated as verified absence merely because the scan is missing.
3. Given scanning coverage is incomplete or unreliable (for example a scanner failure), then a missing entry is not proof of absence and no accuracy bonus is awarded for that meal.
4. Given a credit or bonus is corrected, then the correction is recorded with who, when and why and cannot be edited silently.
5. Given any bonus decision, then it never depends solely on an AI model.

2. Given the guardian taps Reject, then the answer is sent without any video or photo, with an optional reason.
3. Given the guardian taps Accept, then the live confirmation video flow starts.

**Spec rule, quoted from [`design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md`](../design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md).**

#### FR-OUT-006 · Accept starts a four to ten second live video with a phrase and fresh code

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Guardian

**Statement.** Accept starts a live front-camera confirmation video of at least four and at most ten seconds that shows the phrase and a fresh random code for every request and every try.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given Accept, then the camera is live only (no upload and no gallery) and a phrase with a fresh random 3-digit code is shown.
2. Given a recording shorter than four seconds, then it is rejected with Too short, try again.
3. Given a recording reaches ten seconds, then it stops.
4. Given a retry, then a new code is shown and the server stores the time.

#### FR-OUT-007 · The server checks the spoken phrase and code

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Guardian, Warden

**Statement.** The server checks the spoken phrase (tolerant of accent) and the digits (exact) in the chosen language, and a match sends the video to the warden as Video, auto-checked.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a matching phrase and digits, then the warden sees Live video with the Phrase, Code and Number checks.
2. Given the phrase or digits do not match, then the guardian is told we couldn't hear that and may try again.
3. Given a successful automatic check, then the request goes to the warden for final review; the automatic check is not warden approval.

**Spec rule, quoted from [`design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md`](../design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md).**

#### FR-OUT-008 · Retries and the manual-review fallback

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Guardian, Warden

**Statement.** A guardian has up to three tries, and after the third the last video goes to the warden marked Please watch with no automatic checks.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a failed check, then the guardian can try again up to three times with a new code each time.
2. Given the third failure, then Send video to the warden is offered and the video is sent as Please watch with no green checks.

**Spec rule, quoted from [`design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md`](../design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md).**

#### FR-OUT-009 · Upload failure falls back to a live photo and typed code

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Guardian, Warden

**Statement.** If the video cannot upload after two retries, the guardian takes a live photo of their face, types the phrase with the code, and enters a one-time code sent to their phone, and the warden sees Photo and text with no video.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the video cannot upload after two retries, then a live photo (no gallery) is requested.
2. Given the photo, the typed phrase and the phone code, then the answer is sent as Photo and text, no video.
3. Given any missing part, then the answer is not sent.

**Spec rule, quoted from [`design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md`](../design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md).**

#### FR-OUT-010 · Phone confirmation by the warden is a designed fallback needing institutional approval

**Status:** `SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED` · **Roles:** Guardian, Warden

**Statement.** The design includes a fallback in which, if the guardian has no working camera, the request goes to Escalated and the warden phones the guardian and records Confirmed by call with a note; using it in real operation requires institutional approval.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given no working camera, then Ask the warden to call me puts the request in Escalated as No camera (designed behaviour).
2. Given the warden phones and records the answer, then the evidence is Confirmed by call with the warden's note.
3. Given institutional approval has not been given, then the call path is not enabled for real students.
4. Given the call path is used, then the warden's note is the only evidence and no identity-verification guarantee is claimed.

**Spec rule, quoted from [`design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md`](../design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md).**

> 7. No working camera: the guardian cannot approve in the app. The request goes to Escalated; the warden phones the guardian and records "Confirmed by call".

**Note.** Separates a designed fallback from a fallback authorized for real operation. The guardian spec lists whether the call path is allowed as an open item (open decision P30, Conflicts C-16).

#### FR-OUT-011 · Text-only confirmation is never accepted

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Guardian, Warden

**Statement.** Text-only confirmation is never accepted; the guardian's face is always captured by video or live photo, except on the call path which the warden records.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given any approval, then it carries a video, a live photo, or a warden-recorded call.
2. Given a text-only answer, then it is refused.

**Spec rule, quoted from [`design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md`](../design/reference/guardian_2026-10/data/guardian_video_spec.md).**

#### FR-OUT-012 · The warden sees the evidence method and checks

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Warden

**Statement.** The warden sees the evidence for each request tagged as Live video, Please watch, Photo and text, Confirmed by call or No video, with the checks that apply.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a request, then its evidence tag and the checks shown match the method.
2. Given the student view, then the student sees only the method and time and never the video.

#### FR-OUT-013 · The warden decides on guardian-approved requests

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Warden

**Statement.** The warden receives guardian-accepted requests with the evidence for final review, can examine the current request, the verification method, relevant previous guardian responses and the allowed evidence history, and approves, requests changes or rejects with a reason, for authorized hostel or block data only.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a guardian-accepted request, then it appears in the queue closest deadline first with its evidence, verification method and past answers.
2. Given the automatic video check succeeded, then the warden still makes the final decision; the automatic check is not warden approval.
3. Given Approve, then the pass is signed; given Ask, then the guardian is asked to change; given No, then a reason is required.
4. Given another block's request, then the warden cannot see it.

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student, Gate

**Statement.** After the guardian and the warden approve, a signed, time-bound pass is issued that is valid only inside the approved window.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given both approvals, then a pass with a code is issued.

#### FR-OUT-024 · Pilot mode: digital outings for the authorized pilot cohort

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** In the initial institutionally authorized outing pilot, digital outings are available to every student in the authorized pilot cohort; participation and reliability thresholds are not enforced in this phase, and guardian approval and warden approval remain mandatory.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student in the authorized pilot cohort, then Outings is available regardless of participation or reliability.
2. Given a student outside the cohort, then Outings is not available and the existing hostel outing approval procedure is the only route.
3. Given the pilot bypass, then it is an explicit configuration limited to the authorized cohort and cannot apply to students outside it.
4. Given any pilot outing, then guardian approval and warden approval are still required and no timeout approves it (FR-OUT-002, FR-OUT-003).
5. Given the pilot, then live deployment still requires SRM authorization (FR-OUT-027).

#### FR-OUT-025 · Outing deadline rules need institutional approval

**Status:** `SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED` · **Roles:** Guardian, Warden, Student

**Statement.** The weekday and weekend deadlines for the guardian and the warden are drafts that SRM must approve before use.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the draft tables in the source, then none is treated as approved.
2. Given an approved rule, then it is configurable and recorded with its source.

**Status:** `SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED` · **Roles:** Guardian

**Statement.** A guardian is contacted only through a contact verified from an SRM source, and guardian video languages are English, Tamil and Hindi first, subject to approval.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a request, then the guardian number comes from a verified source.
2. Given an unverified number, then no link is sent.

#### FR-OUT-027 · Deploying digital outings depends on SRM

**Status:** `SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED` · **Roles:** Student, Guardian, Warden, Gate

**Statement.** Digital outings are deployed only with SRM authorization (including the authorized pilot cohort), privacy consent, an approved evidence retention rule and a verified guardian contact source.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given any of the four is missing, then digital outings are not activated for students.
2. Given all four are in place, then activation is a recorded Admin action.

#### FR-OUT-028 · Post-pilot eligibility needs participation and reliability

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** After pilot validation, a student is eligible for digital outings only if both (1) participation and (2) reliability are met: participation is consistently submitting a definite I'm in or Skip before the cutoff; reliability is those definite responses matching actual meal behaviour where the verification evidence is trustworthy.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the post-pilot phase, then eligibility requires both participation and reliability; neither alone is enough.
2. Given I'm in and Skip, then they count equally toward participation, and Not sure and No response are not definite responses for participation scoring.
3. Given eligibility scoring, then no answer is favoured and students are never pushed to answer I'm in unnecessarily (FR-RWD-005).
4. Given a missing QR scan, then it is not proof of absence, and a scanner failure never lowers a student's reliability.
5. Given insufficient valid historical evidence, then no reliability threshold is enforced.
6. Given a student who does not qualify, then the existing hostel outing approval procedure remains available.

**Status:** `SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED` · **Roles:** Student, Admin

**Statement.** Eligibility thresholds are configurable, and the evaluation period, the minimum sample size, the exceptions and the thresholds require SRM approval before enforcement; no value is set in this document.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given thresholds, then they are configuration and can be changed without a release.
2. Given no SRM-approved values, then no eligibility threshold is enforced.

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Student

**Statement.** Students can see their eligibility status and request a correction, and students who do not qualify keep the existing hostel outing approval procedure.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a student, then their eligibility status (pilot access, eligible or not eligible) and the reason are visible to them.
2. Given a student disputes the status, then they can request a correction, and the request and its outcome are recorded in an audit trail.
3. Given a student who is not eligible, then the existing hostel outing approval procedure is still available.

### 7.14 AI and intelligence (`FR-AI`)

Principles and evaluation, not implementation.

#### FR-AI-001 · AI is advisory and core dining works without it

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** AI is advisory unless a specific low-risk operation is explicitly approved, and every core dining workflow keeps working when AI is unavailable.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the intelligence service is down, then intentions, headcount, entry, kitchen, supervisor and outing flows still work.
2. Given an AI output, then it is shown as a suggestion and a person decides.

**Dependencies:** none

**Source:** owner decision in task prompt; [`docs/backend/BACKEND_PROPOSAL.md`](../docs/backend/BACKEND_PROPOSAL.md) (Reliability principles 1)

#### FR-AI-002 · AI advises and routes; it never makes sensitive decisions

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin

**Statement.** An AI model never independently approves or sends a headcount, resolves a safety incident, closes a corrective action, rejects a complaint, declares food safe, decides an outing, or makes a publication decision on its own; it may only advise or route to human moderation. Automatic publication by an approved deterministic policy is allowed and is not an AI decision.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given any listed action, then it is taken by an authorized person or, for publication of eligible non-urgent reports, by the approved deterministic policy, and the actor or the policy version is recorded.
2. Given an AI model output, then it is labelled as a suggestion and can only advise or route a report to human moderation.
3. Given an eligible report is published by the deterministic policy (FR-FB-005), then the record names the policy, not a model, as the decision-maker.
4. Given a safety-related report, then no AI model decides whether it is published, closed or declared safe.

### 7.15 Vendor account workflow (`FR-VEN`)

The vendor is a MealLoop user with a restricted account. It is not an external system and there is no direct vendor API. These requirements are confirmed product direction; the screens do not exist in Figma yet, and several rules (a mandatory acknowledgment deadline, escalation, the fallback when the vendor cannot reach MealLoop, and whether an update needs a new acknowledgment) are OPEN in [`OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](OPEN_DECISIONS.md).

#### FR-VEN-001 · The vendor signs in to a restricted MealLoop account

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Vendor

**Statement.** The vendor signs in to its own individual MealLoop-managed account (FR-ID-002), assigned to specific messes. The vendor is a MealLoop user, not an external API integration.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a vendor account assigned to a mess, when the vendor signs in, then it reaches only the vendor views for that mess.
2. Given a mess the vendor account is not explicitly assigned to, then nothing about that mess is visible.
3. Given the vendor account is deactivated, then protected operations are refused (FR-ID-003).
4. Given the requirements and API, then there is no direct vendor API integration.

**Dependencies:** [FR-ID-002](#fr-id-002--other-internal-users-have-individual-mealloop-managed-accounts), [FR-ID-003](#fr-id-003--super-admin-manages-accounts-and-roles), [FR-ATT-015](#fr-att-015--production-staff-authentication-and-authorization)

**Source:** owner decision in the C1 review task prompt (vendor architecture)

**Note.** Vendor sign-in screens are not in Figma (docs/SCREEN_INVENTORY.md, Needs design). Who holds the account at the vendor and how many users it has are OPEN (vendor agreement).

#### FR-VEN-002 · The vendor sees the approved headcount for its assigned mess and authorized updates

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Vendor, Admin

**Statement.** After the Food Head approves and publishes a headcount, the vendor sees the approved headcount for its assigned mess and any later authorized update, and nothing else.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the Food Head has published the approved headcount for a meal, then the vendor sees that value for the assigned mess.
2. Given a headcount that is a forecast or is not approved or not published, then the vendor does not see it.
3. Given the vendor view, then it shows no individual student intention or identity and no dish quantity.
4. Given the Food Head changes the headcount after publishing, then the vendor sees the authorized update (FR-VEN-004).

**Dependencies:** [FR-HC-004](#fr-hc-004--admin-approves-or-adjusts-the-headcount-with-a-reason), [FR-HC-006](#fr-hc-006--the-vendor-receives-a-headcount-only), [FR-VEN-001](#fr-ven-001--the-vendor-signs-in-to-a-restricted-mealloop-account)

**Source:** owner decision in the C1 review task prompt (vendor architecture)

#### FR-VEN-003 · The vendor acknowledges receipt and an acknowledgment is never fabricated

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Vendor, Admin

**Statement.** The vendor acknowledges receipt of the published headcount. MealLoop stores the publication and acknowledgment history. Publishing a headcount is never the same as acknowledgment, and a vendor acknowledgment is never fabricated.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the vendor acknowledges, then the acknowledgment is recorded with the vendor account as actor and the time.
2. Given the vendor has not acknowledged, then the interface shows pending acknowledgment to the Food Head and never shows replied or agreed.
3. Given a headcount was published, then the history shows the publication, its actor and time separately from any acknowledgment.
4. Given the history, then entries cannot be edited or deleted (FR-ADM-016).

**Dependencies:** [FR-VEN-002](#fr-ven-002--the-vendor-sees-the-approved-headcount-for-its-assigned-mess-and-authorized-updates), [FR-HC-007](#fr-hc-007--admin-sees-the-vendor-reply-status), [FR-ADM-016](#fr-adm-016--key-decisions-keep-an-audit-history)

**Source:** owner decision in the C1 review task prompt (vendor architecture)

**Note.** Whether acknowledgment is mandatory before a deadline, the deadline, the escalation recipients and what happens when the vendor cannot reach MealLoop are OPEN (P64, P65).

#### FR-VEN-004 · A later update is shown as an update

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Vendor, Admin

**Statement.** When an approved headcount changes after it was published, the vendor sees the change as an update with its time, and the history keeps both values.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given a later authorized change, then the vendor view shows it as an update, not as a replacement without trace.
2. Given the earlier value was acknowledged, then that acknowledgment stays in the history and is not shown as acknowledging the update.
3. Given the update, then the Food Head sees pending acknowledgment until the vendor account acknowledges it.

**Dependencies:** [FR-HC-008](#fr-hc-008--a-change-after-sending-is-recorded-and-offered-to-the-vendor), [FR-VEN-003](#fr-ven-003--the-vendor-acknowledges-receipt-and-an-acknowledgment-is-never-fabricated)

**Source:** owner decision in the C1 review task prompt (vendor architecture)

**Note.** Whether a later update supersedes an earlier acknowledgment and requires a new one is OPEN (P66); the criteria above only keep the history honest and decide nothing about that rule.

#### FR-VEN-005 · The vendor account is restricted to the approved headcount

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Vendor

**Statement.** The vendor account can sign in, view the approved headcount for its assigned mess, view authorized updates and acknowledge receipt, and can do nothing else.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the vendor account, then it cannot approve or alter a headcount.
2. Given the vendor account, then it cannot see individual student intentions or identities, or guardian evidence.
3. Given the vendor account, then it cannot access another mess without an explicit assignment.
4. Given the vendor account, then it cannot manage rewards, outings, attendance corrections or accounts.
5. Given the vendor account, then it cannot enter production quantities, ingredients, procurement or recipes through this workflow.

### 7.16 Accounts, roles and identity (`FR-ID`)

MealLoop uses two internal authentication arrangements: SRM SSO for Students and Super Admins, and individual MealLoop-managed accounts (email and password) for all other internal users. These requirements are confirmed product direction except where marked. The password policy, multi-factor authentication, lockout and recovery rules, session length, who may provision which roles and the detailed Super Admin permission matrix are OPEN ([`OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](OPEN_DECISIONS.md), P60 to P63).

#### FR-ID-001 · Students and Super Admins sign in through SRM SSO

**Status:** `SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED` · **Roles:** Student, Super Admin

**Statement.** Students and Super Admins are intended to authenticate through SRM's official SSO. This is a required architectural direction, but access to SRM's identity service must be confirmed with SRM IT, so SRM SSO feasibility is unverified. No OAuth, OIDC or SAML endpoint, approved client registration, user attributes or administrative API is assumed to exist, and no fallback identity scheme is approved.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given SRM confirms access, when a Student or Super Admin signs in, then they authenticate through SRM SSO.
2. Given SRM SSO feasibility is unverified, then no real authentication through it is claimed as built.
3. Given any alternative sign-in for the pilot, then it is not described as approved until the owner and SRM approve it.

**Dependencies:** [FR-STU-001](#fr-stu-001--students-sign-in-with-their-srm-identity), [FR-ATT-015](#fr-att-015--production-staff-authentication-and-authorization)

**Source:** owner decision in the C1 review task prompt (identity boundaries)

**Note.** Open questions for SRM IT: the protocol, client registration, available attributes, a test environment, the timeline, and how pilot access works if SSO is not ready (P60).

#### FR-ID-002 · Other internal users have individual MealLoop-managed accounts

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin, Supervisor, Kitchen Staff, Door Scanner Staff, Pass Desk Staff, Warden, Gate Security, Vendor

**Statement.** Food Head / Admin, Supervisor, Kitchen Staff, Door Scanner Staff, Pass Desk Staff, Warden, Gate Security and the Vendor each authenticate with an individual MealLoop-managed account using email and password.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given any of these users, then they have their own account and no shared credential is used in production.
2. Given a production action, then it is attributable to that individual account (FR-ATT-015).
3. Given the shared four-digit role password of the prototype, then it is not accepted as a production method (FR-ATT-013).

**Dependencies:** [FR-ATT-015](#fr-att-015--production-staff-authentication-and-authorization), [FR-ATT-013](#fr-att-013--prototype-staff-entry-uses-a-shared-role-password)

**Source:** owner decision in the C1 review task prompt (identity boundaries)

**Note.** OPEN: password policy, multi-factor authentication, lockout and recovery rules, session length, and who may provision which roles (P61, P62).

#### FR-ID-003 · Super Admin manages accounts and roles

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Super Admin

**Statement.** Super Admin is a separate role that manages system-level identity and institutional configuration: account provisioning, role assignment, scope changes, account deactivation and password-reset initiation.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given Super Admin provisions an account, assigns a role or changes scope, then the action is recorded with actor, time and reason (FR-ADM-016).
2. Given Super Admin deactivates an account, then protected operations by that account are refused from then on.
3. Given Super Admin initiates a password reset, then the user completes it and no password is shown to Super Admin (FR-ID-004).

**Dependencies:** [FR-ID-002](#fr-id-002--other-internal-users-have-individual-mealloop-managed-accounts), [FR-ADM-016](#fr-adm-016--key-decisions-keep-an-audit-history), [FR-ID-004](#fr-id-004--no-one-can-read-a-password)

**Source:** owner decision in the C1 review task prompt (identity boundaries)

**Note.** The detailed Super Admin permission matrix is OPEN and not reviewed; no broader permission is implied (P62).

#### FR-ID-004 · No one can read a password

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Super Admin, all MealLoop-account users

**Statement.** Passwords are never stored or displayed in plaintext. Super Admin cannot read any user's password. Users establish or reset their own credentials through a secure process.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given any screen, API response, log or export, then no password is shown in plaintext.
2. Given Super Admin, then there is no way to read a user's password.
3. Given a new account or a reset, then the user sets their own password through the secure process (FR-ID-006).

**Source:** owner decision in the C1 review task prompt (identity boundaries)

**Note.** The credential storage mechanism is decided in technical design (NFR-SEC-010); this requirement states the outcome only.

#### FR-ID-005 · Food Head / Admin does not have Super Admin privileges

**Status:** `CONFIRMED` · **Roles:** Admin, Super Admin

**Statement.** Food Head / Admin continues to manage operational mess workflows (headcount approval and vendor handoff, menus, reports) and does not have Super Admin privileges. Super Admin and Food Head / Admin are separate roles.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given the Food Head / Admin role, then it cannot provision accounts, assign roles, change scope, deactivate accounts or initiate password resets.
2. Given the role and permission matrix, then Super Admin and Admin are separate columns.

**Dependencies:** [FR-ID-003](#fr-id-003--super-admin-manages-accounts-and-roles), [FR-ADM-015](#fr-adm-015--staff-access-is-managed-by-admin)

#### FR-ID-006 · Invitation and password-reset messages use an external provider

**Status:** `PROPOSED` · **Roles:** Super Admin, all MealLoop-account users

**Statement.** Account invitations and password-reset messages are delivered through an external email or messaging provider. The provider is undecided and its availability is unverified.

**Acceptance criteria.**
1. Given an invitation or reset, then the user receives a message that lets them set their own password.
2. Given delivery fails, then the failure is recorded and the account state is unchanged; a delivery result is never treated as the user completing the reset.
3. Given no provider is chosen, then no delivery is claimed as built.

**Dependencies:** [FR-ID-004](#fr-id-004--no-one-can-read-a-password)

## 8. AI and forecasting requirements

AI is advisory. It supports predictions, feedback analysis and decisions, never replaces a person's decision, and must not be needed for any core dining action. The detailed, testable requirements are the `FR-AI-*` entries above; this section states the principles and the evaluation discipline.

**Principles**

- Core dining (intentions, headcount, entry, kitchen, supervisor, outings) works when AI is down ([FR-AI-001](#fr-ai-001--ai-is-advisory-and-core-dining-works-without-it)).
- An AI model never independently approves or sends a headcount, resolves a safety incident, closes a corrective action, rejects a complaint, declares food safe, decides an outing or makes a publication decision on its own; it may only advise or route to human moderation. Automatic publication of an eligible report by an approved deterministic policy is allowed and is not an AI decision ([FR-AI-002](#fr-ai-002--ai-advises-and-routes-it-never-makes-sensitive-decisions)).
- No prediction, accuracy figure or improvement is stated without a recorded evaluation ([FR-AI-010](#fr-ai-010--no-accuracy-claim-without-a-recorded-evaluation)). An AI-related screen in the design does not mean the AI exists.

**Evaluation discipline (forecasting)**

1. Start from a statistical baseline; compare any machine-learning model against it ([FR-AI-003](#fr-ai-003--forecasting-starts-from-a-statistical-baseline)).
2. Use only features available at the prediction timestamp ([FR-AI-004](#fr-ai-004--only-features-available-at-the-prediction-time-are-used)).
3. Evaluate each candidate signal on unseen data with time-based splits: historical attendance, individual and aggregate arrival patterns, same-day breakfast-to-lunch relationships, class timings, academic calendar and exams, holidays and events, menu popularity. None is assumed useful ([FR-AI-005](#fr-ai-005--forecast-signals-are-evaluated-not-assumed-useful), VALIDATION REQUIRED).
4. Treat attendance prediction and arrival-time prediction as separate tasks ([FR-AI-006](#fr-ai-006--attendance-prediction-and-arrival-time-prediction-are-separate)).
5. Do not call an unvalidated model production-ready.

**Where AI may help** (all optional, all advisory): demand forecasting; arrival-pattern estimates for crowd guidance; feedback grouping and duplicate detection (rules and semantic similarity first; a language model only if testing shows useful administrative value, [FR-AI-008](#fr-ai-008--a-language-model-is-optional-and-added-only-on-evidence)); waste and shortage analysis ([FR-AI-009](#fr-ai-009--waste-analysis-shows-association-not-causation)); menu extraction with human verification ([FR-MENU-001](#fr-menu-001--menu-upload-reads-a-photo-and-flags-uncertain-words)).

## 9. Privacy, consent and security requirements

These are requirement **inputs** to be detailed later (privacy and security tasks). They are topics with a required principle, not yet testable requirements, so they carry a status label but no acceptance criteria here.

| Topic | Required in principle | Related requirements | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Student identity | Students sign in with their SRM identity; staff see masked student IDs only | FR-STU-001, FR-ATT-003 | SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED |
| Staff access, prototype | A shared four-digit password per staff role (three tries, then locked) is approved demo behaviour for the Figma prototype; it is not an approved production security architecture | FR-ATT-013 | CONFIRMED (demo behaviour) |
| Staff access, production | Verified staff identity; an assigned role with mess or block scope; actions attributable to the actor; secure sessions with revocation; auditable approvals, changes, scanning overrides and SOS actions. The mechanism is decided in the NFR, architecture and security reviews | FR-ATT-015, FR-ADM-015, FR-ADM-016 | PROPOSED |
| Guardian video | Recorded only with SRM approval and written consent; face and voice are sensitive; access limited to the warden role and logged | FR-OUT-022 | SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED |
| Evidence retention | A written retention period for guardian evidence (draft in the guardian spec); a retention rule for feedback, skipping reasons and report photos | FR-OUT-022, FR-FB-014 | SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED |
| Student-private data | The private spending tracker never feeds admin data (the calorie and nutrition trackers were archived in the student redesign and are not requirements) | FR-FB-013, FR-ADM-017 | CONFIRMED |
| Feedback privacy | Feedback is aggregate; no names in Community or Admin views | FR-FB-006, FR-FB-013 | CONFIRMED |
| Community publication checks | Eligible non-urgent reports are published automatically only after the configured privacy, safety, abuse and spam checks; flagged or uncertain reports are held for Admin moderation; Admin can hide published content; no student identity is exposed publicly. The exact check rules are details for the API and security design | FR-FB-005, FR-FB-006 | CONFIRMED (policy); rule details to follow |
| Location and photos | SOS proof uses a live photo with place and time; handling and retention of photos is undecided | FR-FB-003 | SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED |
| Audit | Key actions record who, when and why and cannot be edited | FR-ADM-016, FR-HC-004, FR-KIT-012 | CONFIRMED |
| Demo data | Seeded data is labelled, kept apart from pilot data, never presented as measured results, and never included in production analytics | all | CONFIRMED |
| Consent for cameras (Phase 2) | A privacy and institutional review before any return-station camera | FR-KIT-018 | PROPOSED |

## 10. Non-functional requirement inputs

Topics only. **No numbers are given here;** they are set in the non-functional requirements task. Each row is a question that task must answer. The draft non-functional requirements are in [`NFR.md`](NFR.md) (draft, owner review pending).

| Topic | What the NFR task must quantify or define | Related requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Availability | How available the entry, meal-state and kitchen paths must be during a meal service, and how outages are communicated | FR-ATT-002, FR-SUP-001 |
| Offline behaviour | The pilot rule for scanning and pass checks is never record (NFR-REL-005, owner to confirm); a later offline queue is deferred; what is cached for reading | FR-ATT-007, FR-PASS-006 |
| Performance | Responsiveness of scan-to-confirmation, live counts and screen loads; freshness of live counts before they are marked stale | FR-ATT-002, FR-KIT-002 |
| Data integrity | Idempotency and duplicate rejection guarantees; consistency of the shared meal state across roles | FR-ATT-005, FR-SUP-001 |
| Privacy | Handling of masked IDs, guardian video, report photos and location | section 9 |
| Retention | Retention and deletion periods per data type; backup retention | FR-OUT-022, FR-FB-014 |
| Failure behaviour | Behaviour when push, AI, outings or the backend fail (core dining continues; notifications retry from durable records) | FR-AI-001, FR-HC-005 |
| Security | Authentication, authorization per role and mess, secret handling, audit | section 9 |
| Accessibility and language | Dynamic type, contrast, tap-target and language support (English, Tamil and Hindi first for guardian video) | FR-STU-006, FR-OUT-026 |
| Observability | What is logged and monitored, without exposing personal data | all |
| Capacity | Concurrent users and entries at peak, for one mess and for all messes | FR-ATT-002 |
| Device and network | Supported iOS versions, devices and the network conditions at the mess | all |

## 11. Dependencies, assumptions and risks

### Dependencies

| # | Dependency | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | SRM authorization of the pilot at Meenakshi Girls' Mess | Phase 1 |
| D2 | SRM approval of privacy, consent and retention for guardian evidence | Digital outings |
| D3 | A verified guardian contact source | Digital outings |
| D4 | SRM approval of the participation-credit and accuracy-bonus amounts, the reward budget, reward values and redemption, and of the incentive scheme | Credits and rewards |
| D5 | Vendor willingness to receive and reply to a headcount by an agreed channel | Headcount |
| D6 | Staff and institutional approval to measure unserved food for a baseline | Baseline and success metrics |
| D7 | A working backend and database | Everything beyond the design demo |
| D8 | Recorded evidence of the foundation build and its unit-test result (the owner reports a build and launch on the owner's Mac; `docs/FOUNDATION_VERIFICATION.md` does not exist yet) | Implementation |
| D9 | SRM authorization of the outing pilot cohort, and later of the eligibility thresholds, evaluation period, minimum sample size and exceptions | Digital outings |

### Assumptions (not facts)

| # | Assumption |
|---|---|
| A1 | The pilot mess has the connectivity and devices that door, desk and kitchen staff need; this has not been surveyed. |
| A2 | Enough students will answer for the forecast to be useful; participation is unknown. |
| A3 | The vendor will accept an approved headcount as the only input. |
| A4 | The institution will allow QR entry scanning at a common entrance. |
| A5 | The design's sample data is a fair picture of the real flows; real volumes are unknown. |

### Risks

| # | Risk | Mitigation direction |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | The 10 November 2026 target (every approved, active screen in SwiftUI) is large against the time left: [`SCREEN_INVENTORY.md`](SCREEN_INVENTORY.md) counts 420 active screens and states (149 distinct base screens), 20 rows needing review and 89 archived rows, and 12 weekdays from 23 October to 10 November, which its effort note puts at 8.8 states (3.1 base screens) per person per working day with four people, before review and fixes. The milestone is not weakened. | Record the risk; the owner sets the scope; proposed priority P0 first. |
| R2 | The foundation's unit-test result is not recorded and no build output is in the repository (the owner reports a build and launch on the owner's Mac). | Record the result in `docs/FOUNDATION_VERIFICATION.md`. |
| R3 | SRM approvals (outings, guardian video, rewards) may not arrive in time. | Keep outings and rewards behind approval; do not block dining. |
| R4 | Forecast signals may add little value. | Baseline first; validate each signal; do not assume. |
| R5 | A missing or late waste record weakens the baseline and the results. | Make recording simple; show Not recorded honestly; never treat missing as zero. |
| R6 | Older documents still describe superseded behaviour and could be built by mistake. | The Conflicts table and Superseded notes in the old documents. |
| R7 | Speech recognition for Indian languages may be too weak to auto-check guardian videos. | Measure first; fall back to warden review. |
| R8 | Automatic Community publication could publish something harmful, identifying or abusive if the configured checks are wrong. | Configured checks, a held-for-moderation queue, Admin hide, the urgent bypass (FR-FB-003) and no identity exposure; evaluate in the pilot. |
| R9 | Staff adoption: door, desk and kitchen staff add steps to a busy service. | Keep steps minimal; test on the pilot floor. |
| R10 | Participation credits for Skip and I'm in could be gamed by answering carelessly. | The accuracy bonus and the verification rules are the mitigation; evaluate behaviour in the pilot. |
| R11 | The outing pilot bypass could be misconfigured and reach students outside the authorized cohort. | An explicit cohort-limited configuration with an audit trail (FR-OUT-024). |
| R12 | A missing QR scan could be read as absence and unfairly lower credits or outing reliability. | A missing scan is not proof of absence (FR-RWD-003, FR-OUT-028); no threshold is enforced without enough valid evidence. |

## 12. Success metrics and pilot evaluation

**All targets are VALIDATION REQUIRED.** No baseline data exists and none is invented here. Targets are set only after a baseline is measured.

**Baseline.** Establish an initial baseline by measuring unserved food over roughly 7 to 14 days, subject to staff and institutional approval. NGO donation records do not capture total unserved food and must not be presented as if they did.

| Metric | What is compared | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Unserved food by dish | Leftovers per dish in comparable units (kg, L, pieces separately) | Units never added; Not entered is excluded, not counted as zero |
| Waste per reliably measured diner | Unserved food against Final entries for meals with complete evidence | Appropriate baseline needed; only reliably measured meals |
| Forecast accuracy | Forecast against Final entries | Baseline method first; evaluation on unseen data |
| Shortage incidents | Count and timing of shortage reports and resolutions | Reported by the kitchen; resolved by the Supervisor |
| Intention participation | Share of students giving a definite response before the cutoff | Not Sure and No response reported separately |
| Verified entry coverage | Entries recorded against students who ate, where measurable | Entries confirm entry only |
| Feedback resolution | Issues reaching corrective action completed, and the share with verified improvement | Completed is not the same as verified |

**Evaluation rules.** Compare like with like; state the data period and method; report missing data as missing; mark anything unmeasured as unmeasured; do not report improvement without the follow-up evidence in [FR-FB-012](#fr-fb-012--student-follow-up-verifies-real-improvement). Waste reduction is not claimed until it is measured.

## 13. Delivery milestones

These are targets, not commitments.

| When | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 10 November 2026 | Every approved, active Figma screen represented in functional SwiftUI flows, with coherent navigation and demo data isolated from production |
| 11–13 November 2026 | External Review 3 |
| 13 December 2026 | Target for integrated iOS and backend feature completeness, including the outing eligibility engine and the pilot-bypass configuration (real deployment stays gated on SRM authorization) |
| January 2027 | Stabilization and review |
| 27–29 January 2027 | External Review 4 |
| February–March 2027 | Pilot, where institutionally authorized |
| 8–9 April 2027 | External Review 5 |
| April 2027 | Pilot validation and institutional demonstration |
| 16 April 2027 | App Fair |

**Platform direction (PROPOSED inputs for the ADR task, not approved designs):** native iOS (SwiftUI) first; Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) later; a shared Spring Boot and PostgreSQL backend. See [`docs/adr/`](adr/ADR-001-ios-architecture.md) and [`docs/backend/`](backend/BACKEND_PROPOSAL.md).

## 14. Open decisions

The full list, each with options and a suggested default, is in [`OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](OPEN_DECISIONS.md), which also has a **Resolved** section and the **Conflicts** table. The decisions that most affect this PRD:

- **Resolved since version 0.1 by owner decisions:** Community publication (automatic after configured checks), the credits and accuracy-bonus direction, and the structure of outing eligibility (pilot mode, then participation and reliability).
- Official SRM outing policy and escalation authority; the authorized outing pilot cohort; the post-pilot eligibility thresholds, evaluation period, minimum sample size and exceptions; the verified guardian contact source.
- Guardian video retention, consent and privacy approval; speech-recognition accuracy; institutional approval of the warden phone-confirmation fallback.
- Student authentication source.
- Scanner offline behaviour: resolved for the pilot as never record (NFR-REL-005, owner to confirm); a future offline queue is deferred.
- Vendor communication channel (WhatsApp, call or SMS).
- The exact participation-credit and accuracy-bonus amounts, the redemption budget and reward values, and institutional approval of the incentive scheme; the reliable absence-verification method and the minimum verification coverage.
- The production staff authentication and authorization mechanism (technical design).
- Pilot data availability and success thresholds; the Community support threshold.
- Whether students answer for Snacks; the meaning of the yellow menu highlight; how long a missed meal's waste can still be recorded.

## 15. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Intention / response | A student's answer for one meal: I'm in, Skip, Not sure, or No response |
| No response | No answer was given. It is its own group and never a Skip |
| Cutoff | Two hours before the meal starts; the last time a response can be set or changed |
| Live forecast | The current estimate of diners, which can still change |
| Cutoff forecast | The forecast as it stood at the cutoff, preserved with its rule version |
| Approved headcount | The headcount Admin approved (or adjusted with a reason) |
| Sent to vendor | The approved headcount as sent to the vendor; a headcount only |
| Actual entries | Live count of students who have entered so far; never final |
| Final entries | The count of recorded entries after the Supervisor closes the meal |
| Entry QR | The student's QR; confirms entry only |
| Entered without voting | The separate list of students who entered with no meal response; not a vote |
| Special-meal pass | A pass with a live code and colour for a special meal; separate from outing passes |
| Pass exception / reissue | A request for a new pass, handled in the admin pass-exception flow |
| Unserved food / leftovers | Food left over after the meal, recorded per dish in its own unit |
| Plate waste | One total in kilograms for the whole meal; never per dish |
| None left | A confirmed measurement of zero leftover for a dish |
| Not made | The dish was not cooked for the meal |
| Not entered | Nothing has been recorded yet; never read as zero |
| Recorded | The status of a saved waste report; there is no approval step |
| Shortage | A report that a dish is getting low, almost out or out |
| SOS | The urgent safety workflow; claimable and checkable by staff, closed by the Supervisor |
| Community / Me too | The student-visible issue list and the one-per-student support action |
| Corrective action | What was done about an issue; completing it is not proof that things improved |
| Improvement verified | Evidence from follow-up that the problem actually improved |
| Sure / Probably / Can't tell | The evidence tags on a result reason; never percentages |
| Evidence method | How a guardian's approval was captured: Live video (auto-checked), Please watch, Photo and text, Confirmed by call |
| Deterministic publication policy | A fixed, approved set of rules that publishes an eligible report automatically; it is not an AI decision |
| Participation | Consistently submitting a definite I'm in or Skip before the cutoff |
| Reliability | Definite responses that match actual meal behaviour where the verification evidence is trustworthy |
| Accuracy bonus | An additional credit when a definite answer matches reliably verified behaviour |
| Pilot cohort | The students the institution authorizes for the outing pilot |
| Outing pass | A signed, time-bound pass issued after both approvals |
| Idempotency key | A unique key sent with a write so a repeat returns the original result |
| Demo data | Seeded, labelled sample data that never mixes with real data |
| OCR / vision | Reading a menu photo into text, always with human verification |
| SLM / LLM | Small or large language model; optional and advisory |

## 16. Requirement status legend

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **CONFIRMED** | Approved product behaviour: stated as approved in the active specifications or by the owner in the task prompt, and not dependent on SRM or a policy number |
| **PROPOSED** | Needs product review before it can be built |
| **SRM APPROVAL REQUIRED** | Depends on a decision or approval from SRM |
| **VALIDATION REQUIRED** | Needs pilot evidence or an evaluation before it can be relied on |
| **CHANGED, OWNER CONFIRMATION REQUIRED** | The task prompt differs from earlier documented behaviour; both are recorded and the owner must choose |

Policy numbers, reward values, thresholds and anything depending on SRM are never CONFIRMED.
