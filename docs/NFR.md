**Status:** DRAFT — Owner review pending (not owner-approved)

## Change log

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 2026-10-23 | Review draft written by the owner and ChatGPT. |
| 0.2 | 2026-10-23 | Two fields (Status and Depends on) replace hybrid statuses; proposed milestone tags and Related PRD requirements on every requirement; Targets still pending table; offline-scan direction recorded as resolving the functional offline decision (owner to confirm); guardian localization added to NFR-ACC-003; NFR-PER-002 marked provisional; new requirements NFR-REL-009 to 011, NFR-PER-005 to 007, NFR-PRI-007, NFR-SEC-009, NFR-OPS-001, NFR-OBS-005 and NFR-SCL-004; undecided architecture items and an acceptance-evidence template; Appendix A of candidate values (not requirements). |

## 1. Purpose and scope

This document specifies the quality attributes and operational guarantees for MealLoop's student iOS application, mess staff workflows, administrator interfaces, guardian web experience, backend services, and outing-pass system.

It consolidates decisions made in NFR Rounds 1–3 and complements the functional PRD.

### Status definitions

- **Direction confirmed:** The owner has selected this behavior or engineering principle. Detailed implementation is not necessarily approved.
- **Provisional target:** A measurable objective selected for initial engineering/testing, subject to validation.
- **Technical design pending:** The quality requirement is agreed upon, but its implementation will be decided during C4/ADR/API design.
- **SRM approval required:** Activation or policy depends on formal institutional authorization.
- **Validation required:** Real measurements or user testing are necessary before final acceptance.

Each requirement carries two separate fields. **Status** is exactly one of the five values above. **Depends on** is free text for secondary dependencies (for example "SRM integration" or "hosting decision"). Where an earlier draft combined two statuses, the primary status was chosen by this rule: if SRM or legal approval gates activation, *SRM approval required*; else if a number or measured result is missing, *Provisional target* or *Validation required*; else *Direction confirmed*.

### Milestone tags (proposed)

Each requirement has a **Milestone (proposed)** tag. The tags are **PROPOSED** for the owner to confirm; none is approved.

- **M1:** needed for 10 November 2026 (SwiftUI app).
- **M2:** needed for 13 December 2026 (integrated feature completeness).
- **M3:** needed before the pilot or any live activation.
- **Later:** not needed before the pilot.

Where a requirement is tagged once but has parts that fall earlier, the part is named in its text (for example the UI states of NFR-PER-003 are needed for M1).

### Related PRD requirements

Each requirement lists the functional requirements in [`PRD.md`](PRD.md) it relates to. Every ID was checked against the PRD. "To be mapped" means no clear functional requirement exists yet.

## 2. Reliability and data integrity

### NFR-REL-001 — Authoritative meal entries
**Status:** Direction confirmed

**Depends on:** None beyond the backend design

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-002](PRD.md#fr-att-002--scanning-a-valid-qr-records-one-entry), [FR-ATT-007](PRD.md#fr-att-007--an-offline-or-unverifiable-scan-is-never-shown-as-success), [FR-PASS-006](PRD.md#fr-pass-006--an-unverified-pass-check-is-never-shown-as-success)

**Requirement:** A digital meal entry must be displayed as successfully recorded only after the backend has verified and durably committed it.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- A failed, timed-out, rejected, or offline request never produces a successful entry result.
- An uncertain outcome displays a verification-required state rather than assuming success.
- Retry behavior cannot create duplicate attendance.

**Verification:** Disconnect the network, delay responses, simulate server failures, and retry transactions while examining database records.

### NFR-REL-002 — Duplicate prevention
**Status:** Direction confirmed

**Depends on:** None beyond the backend design

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-005](PRD.md#fr-att-005--a-student-is-recorded-at-most-once-per-meal), [FR-PASS-004](PRD.md#fr-pass-004--a-special-meal-entry-is-recorded-at-most-once)

**Requirement:** At most one accepted regular entry record may exist per student per meal, even with simultaneous scanners.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Concurrent valid attempts result in one accepted entry.
- Duplicate requests do not increase the attendance count.
- Retrying a completed request produces a consistent result.
- Special-meal consumption remains independently constrained by its own rules.

**Verification:** Concurrent request tests, duplicate-key tests, and database invariant checks.

### NFR-REL-003 — Consistent meal lifecycle
**Status:** Direction confirmed

**Depends on:** None beyond the backend design

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-SUP-001](PRD.md#fr-sup-001--the-supervisor-starts-the-meal-for-the-mess), [FR-SUP-002](PRD.md#fr-sup-002--the-supervisor-closes-the-meal), [FR-SUP-004](PRD.md#fr-sup-004--the-supervisor-follows-up-and-resolves-shortages), [FR-ATT-008](PRD.md#fr-att-008--scanning-is-open-only-while-the-meal-is-in-service), [FR-PASS-008](PRD.md#fr-pass-008--pass-desk-follows-the-meal-state)

**Requirement:** Meal start and closure use one authoritative backend state, consistent across authorized staff roles.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Opening a meal permits the corresponding authorized entry operations.
- Closing a meal prevents subsequent ordinary entries even if a client screen is stale.
- Invalid lifecycle transitions are rejected.
- Meal closure does not automatically resolve shortages, SOS incidents, or missing waste reports.

**Verification:** State-machine tests, role-to-role integration tests, simultaneous close-and-scan tests.

### NFR-REL-004 — Cross-role synchronization
**Status:** Provisional target

**Depends on:** Validation of the percentile, the test-network specification and the maximum refresh delay

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-009](PRD.md#fr-att-009--live-entry-count-is-shown-as-recorded-entries-only), [FR-SUP-003](PRD.md#fr-sup-003--supervisor-home-follows-the-meal-state), [FR-SUP-007](PRD.md#fr-sup-007--supervisor-alerts-and-history-show-the-same-tasks-everywhere), [FR-KIT-002](PRD.md#fr-kit-002--during-the-meal-the-kitchen-sees-students-entered-only), [FR-KIT-016](PRD.md#fr-kit-016--pass-desk-food-shortages-reach-the-kitchen)

**Requirement:** Connected staff interfaces should reflect committed meal-state and operational changes within five seconds under normal pilot conditions.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- New state is eventually shown without requiring users to sign out.
- Screens indicate stale or unavailable information when synchronization fails.
- API operations enforce current server state regardless of client update delay.

**Verification:** Time synchronized tests across Supervisor, Door Scanner, Pass Desk and Kitchen clients, including reconnect scenarios.

**Open:** The final percentile, test-network specification and maximum acceptable refresh delay require validation.

### NFR-REL-005 — Offline entry policy
**Status:** Direction confirmed

**Depends on:** None. This is the owner direction that resolves the pilot offline-scan decision (see the decision note)

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-007](PRD.md#fr-att-007--an-offline-or-unverifiable-scan-is-never-shown-as-success), [FR-PASS-006](PRD.md#fr-pass-006--an-unverified-pass-check-is-never-shown-as-success)

**Requirement:** The initial pilot must not accept an offline QR scan as a digitally verified meal entry.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The scanner explicitly displays that entry was not recorded.
- The system never claims a pending offline entry is committed.
- Restoring connectivity does not silently replay an unverified entry.

**Verification:** Offline and network-flapping tests.

**Decision note.** This records the owner's later direction that the pilot never accepts an offline scan as a verified entry. It resolves the functional decision on scanner offline behaviour (OPEN_DECISIONS R21, formerly P5): in the pilot an offline scan is never recorded and never shown as success. A future offline queue is deferred and is not part of the pilot. **The owner is asked to confirm this reading.**

### NFR-REL-006 — Manual continuity and reconciliation
**Status:** SRM approval required

**Depends on:** SRM-approved manual attendance procedure; the authorized reconcilers; reporting treatment

**Milestone (proposed):** M3

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-003](PRD.md#fr-att-003--staff-can-type-the-last-4-digits-when-a-qr-cannot-be-scanned), [FR-MEAL-004](PRD.md#fr-meal-004--answering-is-voluntary-and-the-entry-qr-is-never-locked); manual reconciliation itself: to be mapped

**Requirement:** Meal service must be able to continue during a digital outage under an approved manual attendance procedure.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Students are not denied ordinary meal service solely because MealLoop is unavailable.
- Reconciled records identify their manual source, actor and time of reconciliation.
- Conflicts with already verified entries are detected and reviewed.
- Reports distinguish QR-verified records from manually reconciled records.
- Reconciliation does not fabricate historical QR verification.

**Verification:** Simulated full-backend outage, manual service exercise, recovery and reconciliation test.

**Open:** Institutional manual logging process, authorized reconcilers, evidence required and reporting treatment.

### NFR-REL-007 — Missing data integrity
**Status:** Direction confirmed

**Depends on:** None beyond the data-model design

**Milestone (proposed):** M1

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-KIT-006](PRD.md#fr-kit-006--leftovers-are-recorded-per-dish-in-the-dishs-own-unit), [FR-KIT-008](PRD.md#fr-kit-008--waste-fields-are-entered-none-left-not-made-or-not-entered), [FR-KIT-009](PRD.md#fr-kit-009--drafts-save-freely-the-final-save-is-blocked-while-fields-are-empty), [FR-KIT-013](PRD.md#fr-kit-013--a-meal-without-a-report-shows-not-recorded), [FR-HC-002](PRD.md#fr-hc-002--headcount-quantities-are-separate-and-never-merged), [FR-CRD-002](PRD.md#fr-crd-002--honest-insufficient-data-states)

**Requirement:** Missing, unavailable, zero and not-applicable measurements must remain distinguishable.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- An unrecorded waste quantity never becomes zero.
- Not made and None left remain separate.
- Final entries remain unavailable until the appropriate meal closure state.
- Quantities in incompatible units are not incorrectly aggregated.
- Analytics identify incomplete datasets.

**Verification:** Data-model invariants, serialization tests, reporting tests with partial data.

### NFR-REL-008 — Optional AI failure isolation
**Status:** Direction confirmed

**Depends on:** None beyond the architecture

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-AI-001](PRD.md#fr-ai-001--ai-is-advisory-and-core-dining-works-without-it), [FR-AI-002](PRD.md#fr-ai-002--ai-advises-and-routes-it-never-makes-sensitive-decisions)

**Requirement:** Core dining and outing transactions must continue when optional AI services are unavailable.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Student responses, approved headcounts, scanning, waste reports, SOS and outing decisions do not depend on synchronous AI availability.
- Unavailable predictions are labelled as unavailable or replaced only by an explicitly approved baseline.
- No AI outage causes automatic institutional approval.

**Verification:** Disable AI dependencies during end-to-end workflow tests.

### NFR-REL-009 — SOS delivery and fallback
**Status:** Technical design pending

**Depends on:** SOS delivery time (Appendix A); the notification channel and escalation design

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-FB-004](PRD.md#fr-fb-004--an-sos-reaches-staff-and-the-admin-safety-case), [FR-ATT-012](PRD.md#fr-att-012--door-staff-can-claim-and-check-an-sos-but-not-close-it), [FR-KIT-017](PRD.md#fr-kit-017--the-kitchen-can-claim-and-check-an-sos), [FR-PASS-010](PRD.md#fr-pass-010--pass-desk-can-claim-and-check-an-sos), [FR-SUP-006](PRD.md#fr-sup-006--only-the-supervisor-closes-an-sos-case-in-the-staff-app), [FR-ADM-010](PRD.md#fr-adm-010--the-safety-case-follows-an-urgent-report-to-its-close)

**Requirement:** An SOS reaches the Supervisor and the relevant staff within a defined delivery time; a failed push does not lose the SOS; an unacknowledged SOS escalates to a second authorized person; the SOS state (active, claimed, checked, closed) is authoritative on the server.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The delivery-time target is pending (Appendix A lists a candidate for discussion only).
- A failed push notification never loses the SOS: it remains visible in the app and the Admin Safety case.
- An unacknowledged SOS escalates to a second authorized person.
- Active, claimed, checked and closed are server states; a client cannot show a state the server has not recorded.

**Verification:** Inject push failures and unacknowledged SOS cases; compare the server SOS state with each client; measure time to delivery once a target is set.

### NFR-REL-010 — Server time authority
**Status:** Technical design pending

**Depends on:** Permitted clock skew is not decided

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-MEAL-003](PRD.md#fr-meal-003--responses-can-be-changed-until-two-hours-before-the-meal), [FR-KIT-011](PRD.md#fr-kit-011--a-recorded-report-can-be-edited-for-six-hours), [FR-PASS-001](PRD.md#fr-pass-001--the-special-meal-pass-shows-a-changing-code-and-colour), [FR-OUT-006](PRD.md#fr-out-006--accept-starts-a-four-to-ten-second-live-video-with-a-phrase-and-fresh-code), [FR-OUT-015](PRD.md#fr-out-015--a-signed-time-bound-pass-is-issued-after-both-approvals)

**Requirement:** The two-hour response cutoff, the six-hour waste-edit window, the rotating special-pass code and colour, the guardian confirmation code and the outing pass validity windows use server time in IST. A device clock never decides eligibility or validity.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- A device with a wrong clock cannot extend or shorten any of these windows.
- The permitted clock skew is pending.
- Every window decision records the server time used.

**Verification:** Change the device clock in tests and confirm no window decision changes; test the boundaries of each window against server time.

### NFR-REL-011 — Site connectivity
**Status:** Validation required

**Depends on:** Site survey results; the minimum acceptable signal defined by the owner

**Milestone (proposed):** M3

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-007](PRD.md#fr-att-007--an-offline-or-unverifiable-scan-is-never-shown-as-success), [FR-PASS-006](PRD.md#fr-pass-006--an-unverified-pass-check-is-never-shown-as-success), [FR-OUT-016](PRD.md#fr-out-016--the-gate-checks-the-pass-and-window)

**Requirement:** Because offline scans are not accepted, a site survey of Wi-Fi and mobile coverage at the Door, Pass Desk, kitchen and supervisor positions (and the Gate for outings) must be completed and recorded before the pilot, with a minimum acceptable signal defined by the owner.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- A recorded survey exists for each listed position.
- The owner has defined the minimum acceptable signal.
- A position below the minimum has a recorded remedy before the pilot.

**Verification:** Survey each position during a meal service and record the result; review the record before the pilot.

## 3. Performance and responsiveness

### NFR-PER-001 — Verified scanning latency
**Status:** Provisional target

**Depends on:** Device specifications, test-network conditions and peak concurrency

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-002](PRD.md#fr-att-002--scanning-a-valid-qr-records-one-entry), [FR-PASS-002](PRD.md#fr-pass-002--the-desk-compares-code-and-colour-and-records-only-on-matches)

**Requirement:** At least 95% of ordinary online scan-confirmation operations should display the verified backend result within two seconds under defined normal pilot test conditions.

**Measurement:** Time from scanner confirmation/recognized-code submission until the final verified result is rendered, including API and database processing.

**Verification:** Instrumented physical-device and backend tests, reporting p50, p95, p99 and errors.

**Open:** Device specifications, test-network conditions and peak concurrency.

### NFR-PER-002 — Initial peak load
**Status:** Provisional target

**Depends on:** Number of students in the pilot mess; measured pilot data; burst duration and final capacity target

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-002](PRD.md#fr-att-002--scanning-a-valid-qr-records-one-entry), [FR-ATT-005](PRD.md#fr-att-005--a-student-is-recorded-at-most-once-per-meal)

**Requirement:** The backend should correctly process an initial burst-test workload of ten entry requests per second.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- No duplicate successful records.
- No silently lost committed records.
- Rejections and timeout outcomes are accurately reported.
- Latency and error rates are measured throughout the test.

**Verification:** Automated load test using a representative mixture of successful, duplicate, invalid and conflicting attempts.

**Open:** Burst duration, realistic peak rate and final capacity target. The ten-requests-per-second figure is a provisional starting point only. The realistic door peak must be derived from measured pilot data and this figure replaced by it. Open input: the number of students in the pilot mess.

### NFR-PER-003 — Responsive critical operations
**Status:** Technical design pending

**Depends on:** Client and API design (C4 and API work)

**Milestone (proposed):** M1

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-007](PRD.md#fr-att-007--an-offline-or-unverifiable-scan-is-never-shown-as-success), [FR-PASS-006](PRD.md#fr-pass-006--an-unverified-pass-check-is-never-shown-as-success), [FR-KIT-010](PRD.md#fr-kit-010--a-saved-report-is-recorded-with-no-approval-loop), [FR-SUP-002](PRD.md#fr-sup-002--the-supervisor-closes-the-meal)

**Requirement:** Long-running or unavailable services must not leave staff interfaces indefinitely blocked.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Critical actions show pending, confirmed, failed or uncertain outcomes as appropriate.
- Repeated taps cannot create duplicate actions.
- Network timeouts have a visible recovery path.
- The interface never displays a success result before authoritative confirmation.

**Verification:** Latency injection, rapid repeated-tap testing, retry and timeout testing.

**Milestone note.** The pending, failed and uncertain UI states are needed for M1; the server-side idempotency that backs them follows the other M2 work.

### NFR-PER-004 — Outage recovery objectives
**Status:** Validation required

**Depends on:** Hosting decision; the recovery and availability objectives (see Appendix A); backup schedule

**Milestone (proposed):** M3

**Related PRD requirements:** to be mapped

**Requirement:** Define and test recovery-time and recovery-point objectives appropriate to meal operations, institutional responsibilities and available infrastructure.

**Acceptance criteria:** The approved targets, backup strategy, restoration procedure and test evidence are documented before production activation.

**Verification:** Database restoration and controlled failure exercises.

**Open:** Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective (RPO), target availability and backup schedule. No numerical objective is approved yet.

### NFR-PER-005 — Intention and reminder burst load
**Status:** Validation required

**Depends on:** Number of students in the pilot mess

**Milestone (proposed):** M3

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-MEAL-003](PRD.md#fr-meal-003--responses-can-be-changed-until-two-hours-before-the-meal), [FR-MEAL-006](PRD.md#fr-meal-006--one-default-reminder-before-the-cutoff-plus-optional-reminders), [FR-HC-001](PRD.md#fr-hc-001--the-forecast-accounts-for-every-response-category)

**Requirement:** The system handles the burst of student responses around the reminder and the cutoff, and admin dashboards load correctly under that burst. The load is sized from the real number of students in the pilot mess (an open input), and the same duplicate and idempotency rules apply.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Responses around the reminder and the cutoff are recorded correctly with no duplicates and no lost committed responses.
- Admin dashboards load correctly during the burst.
- The load profile is derived from the pilot mess student count once it is known.

**Verification:** Replay a burst of responses sized from the pilot mess student count and check records, dashboards and error rates.

### NFR-PER-006 — Guardian video on mobile web
**Status:** Validation required

**Depends on:** Supported mobile-browser list and the video size limit are not decided

**Milestone (proposed):** M3

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-OUT-006](PRD.md#fr-out-006--accept-starts-a-four-to-ten-second-live-video-with-a-phrase-and-fresh-code), [FR-OUT-008](PRD.md#fr-out-008--retries-and-the-manual-review-fallback), [FR-OUT-009](PRD.md#fr-out-009--upload-failure-falls-back-to-a-live-photo-and-typed-code)

**Requirement:** The guardian recording and upload work on supported mobile browsers (a supported-browser list is pending), tolerate slow and interrupted networks (resumable or retried upload, no duplicate submissions), handle denied camera permission with the documented fallbacks, and keep file size bounded (limit pending).

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Recording and upload work on every browser in the supported list once it exists.
- An interrupted upload resumes or retries without creating duplicate submissions.
- A denied camera permission leads to the documented fallbacks.
- An over-limit file is handled with a clear message and a fallback.

**Verification:** Test supported browsers and devices on throttled and interrupted networks; deny camera permission; exceed the size limit.

### NFR-PER-007 — Door throughput rehearsal
**Status:** Validation required

**Depends on:** A realistic door rehearsal; the device and network conditions

**Milestone (proposed):** M3

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-ATT-002](PRD.md#fr-att-002--scanning-a-valid-qr-records-one-entry)

**Requirement:** Measure how many students per minute one door position can process in a realistic rehearsal (device, network, queue conditions). The target is derived from the rehearsal, not assumed.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- A rehearsal is run with real devices and queue conditions and its results are recorded.
- The throughput target is set from the recorded results.

**Verification:** Run a door rehearsal and record students per minute, errors and the conditions.

## 4. Authentication, authorization and security

### NFR-SEC-001 — Production identity
**Status:** Direction confirmed

**Depends on:** SRM integration for student sign-in; the production identity mechanism (FR-ATT-015, decided in security review)

**Milestone (proposed):** M2

**Related PRD requirements:** [FR-STU-001](PRD.md#fr-stu-001--students-sign-in-with-their-srm-identity), [FR-ATT-013](PRD.md#fr-att-013--prototype-staff-entry-uses-a-shared-role-password), [FR-ATT-015](PRD.md#fr-att-015--production-staff-authentication-and-authorization)

**Requirement:** Student access should use institution-verified identity where available. Production staff actions must be attributable to individually authenticated staff members.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Staff sessions identify the actor and authorized role.
- Account deactivation prevents further protected operations.
- Debug/demo shared-role passwords are not sufficient as sole production authentication.
- Staff role selection does not grant permissions by itself.

**Verification:** Authentication tests, disabled-account tests, impersonation attempts and staff handover tests.

### NFR-SEC-002 — Server-side action authorization
**Status:** Direction confirmed

## 11. Architecture constraints and non-decisions

The NFR does not itself approve:
- A specific cloud hosting provider
- WebSockets versus polling
- Microservices versus modular monolith
- Redis, Kafka or Kubernetes
- A specific identity provider
- A guardian video storage provider
- A particular monitoring service
- Any unmeasured latency, capacity or availability guarantee

These choices belong to C4 architecture and ADR reviews.

- A hosting-cost ceiling (see NFR-SCL-004).
- The choice of guardian-video storage.

The existing Spring Boot/PostgreSQL modular-monolith proposal may be evaluated against these NFRs, but is not automatically approved merely because it already exists in the repository.

## 12. NFR acceptance evidence

Each requirement shall eventually be linked to:
1. Its owning functional requirements.
2. The component or service responsible.
3. An automated test, operational exercise or documented institutional approval.
4. Test results and the environment in which those results were produced.
5. Its readiness status: not started, implemented, verified or approved for deployment.

An implemented interface is not equivalent to verified operational behavior.

The table below is the template. The filled table is [`NFR_TRACEABILITY.md`](NFR_TRACEABILITY.md).

| NFR ID | Owning functional requirements | Component | Test or exercise | Environment | Readiness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFR identifier | Functional requirement identifiers | Component or service | Automated test, operational exercise or approval | Where the result was produced | not started / implemented / verified / approved for deployment |

## Appendix A. Candidate values for owner decision (NOT requirements)

These are suggested starting points for discussion only. They are not approved, they are not requirements, and they must be validated against the real hosting provider and pilot data. They are never to be copied into a requirement statement.

| Topic | Candidate starting point | Linked to |
|---|---|---|
| Availability | about 99% during meal-service windows, best effort outside them | [NFR-PER-004](#nfr-per-004--outage-recovery-objectives) |
| RPO (acceptable data loss) | about 15 minutes | [NFR-PER-004](#nfr-per-004--outage-recovery-objectives) |
| RTO (time to recover) | about 1 hour, because a manual fallback exists | [NFR-PER-004](#nfr-per-004--outage-recovery-objectives) |
| SOS delivery to the Supervisor | about 10 seconds, with a fallback | [NFR-REL-009](#nfr-rel-009--sos-delivery-and-fallback) |
| Door throughput | to be set from the rehearsal in NFR-PER-007 | [NFR-PER-007](#nfr-per-007--door-throughput-rehearsal) |

**Document status remains DRAFT, owner review pending, until explicit owner review and approval.**
